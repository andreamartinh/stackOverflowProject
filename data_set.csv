Xml feeds are pretty long, and my table is continuesly **busy**, i am using that table from **view** side also.

What you think how i can free processes? Using multiple connections maybe or by copying data to another table what is not used by cron?

2948878,,"I'm using Fltk to render openGL graphs. currently I'm debugging a global array which is sorted by a heapsort function. My purpose is to see after each swap of elements in the heapsort function a graphical swap of elements. but I don't want to catch an event from FLTK event_handle for every time i need to redraw after I swapped and waiting at breakpoint. (the heapsort function and the opengl render part are running in 2 different threads (if that doesn't has to go without saying)).
So the first try I had was to use:

    Fl::add_timeout(1.0, MyRedrawCallback, (void *)&myWindow);
    
    Fl::run();
    
    void MyRedrawCallback(void *myWindow)
    
    {
    
    	MyWindow *pMyWindow;
    
    	pMyWindow = (MyWindow *) myWindow;
    	pMyWindow->redraw();
    	Fl::repeat_timeout(1.0, MyRedrawCallback, (void *)&pMyWindow);
    }

But every Time the callback is called the 2nd time i get an ""Access violation reading""

I'm suggesting that FL::run starts a different thread so maybe the first time is still in same thread so the address of redraw is still usable but after that I'm in a different thread and the function at address is not that what I'm expecting?!

But I already took a different way because I wasn't sure i cant even use the timeout on this way.
So i was looking for a way to get an event that's eq to ""set amount of time passed"" or ""nothing is happening for..."" but there isn't such a handle I'm right?

Finally is there a way to let FLTK execute commands even outside the eventloop? or is there another way to solve my problem?",fixed grammar,,1,1/30/17 14:13,force FLTK to redraw without event Handles,<c++><event-handling><redraw><fltk>,1192,4/23/14 9:24,138,251,110,,,"<p>I work as software developer (C++, C, C#) in the Augsburg area.</p>

Here's what I did to fix it (works for Linux and for one of my developers who is blind and has to use Cygwin)...

- Remove the line that says, `APP_STL := gnustl_static` from your `Application.mk` (it's broken in the NDK, and it's broken slightly differently on Linux Cygwin, Windows)
- add a line to `$(LOCAL_LDLIBS)` in your `Android.mk` file that says:

    $(NDK_ROOT)/sources/cxx-stl/gnu-libstdc++/4.6/libs/armeabi-v7a/libgnustl_static.a

also add two lines to `Android.mk` that say:

    LOCAL_C_INCLUDES := $(NDK_ROOT)/sources/cxx-stl/gnu-libstdc++/4.6/include
    LOCAL_C_INCLUDES += $(NDK_ROOT)/sources/cxx-stl/gnu-libstdc++/4.6/libs/armeabi-v7a/include

The foregoing will accomplish what having, `APP_STL := gnustl_static` in your `Application.mk` was supposed to.

                </Col>
*(I snipped the rest of the code because it was long and not useful here)*


The array (a separate file) is imported into the Parent component and it reads like this

    const players = [
      {
        name: 'Jabba',
        score: 10,
        id: 11
      },
      {
        name: 'Han',
        score: 10,
        id: 1
      },
      {
        name: 'Rey',
        score: 30,
        id: 10
      }
    ];
    
    export default players;

So what I'm trying to do is write a function on the main parent that when it is clicked inside the child, the div is removed, deleted, gone (whatever the best term is) sort of like ""remove player, add player""

On my parent component, I've written a function where the console.log works when it is clicked in the child, but whatever I write in the function doesn't seem to want to work.

The function I'm building (in progress, I'm still a little lost here) is: 

      removePlayer() {
        console.log('this was removed');
        players.splice(2, 0, 'Luke', 'Vader');
      }

which is mapped over here as a prop

    const listPlayers = players.map(player => (
      <Counter
        key={player.id}
        player={player}
        name={player.name}
        sortableGroupDecorator={this.sortableGroupDecorator}
        decrementCountTotal={this.decrementCountTotal}
        incrementCountTotal={this.incrementCountTotal}
        removePlayer={this.removePlayer}
        handleClick={player}
      />
    ));

And passed into the child here:

    render() {
    const {
      name,
      sortableGroupDecorator,
      decrementCountTotal,
      incrementCountTotal,
      removePlayer
    } = this.props;

    return (
      <div
        style={{ display: this.state.displayInfo }}
        className=""group-list""
        ref={sortableGroupDecorator}
        id=""cell""
      >
        <CountCell style={{ background: this.state.color }}>
          <Row style={{ alignItems: 'center', marginLeft: '-42px' }}>
            <Col>
              <DeleteButton onClick={removePlayer}>
                <Icon name=""delete"" className=""delete-adjust fa-minus-circle"" />

    optionMenu.popoverPresentationController?.sourceView = self.view
    optionMenu.popoverPresentationController?.sourceRect = self.view.bounds
 but it didnt worked for me maybe because my ActionSheet's Sender is on a UItableviewCell.

Basically what I want to do is;

 1. First `li a` element within first `UL` is clicked. A class of `active` is added to the list element. I've done this so far using`$(this).parents('li').addClass(""active"");`

 2. The next `UL` `sub_topic_category` is displayed(I've done this via CSS and it works) depending on which list element in active.

 3. This is the part I am stuck at. I now need to make only list elements within the `sub_topic_category` displayed change class. When one list element `a` tag is clicked the class `active` is added to `li` parent of link clicked and the previous `active` class is removed WITHIN THAT SUB TOPIC LIST ONLY.


----------


So for example in the code shown I have `Type4` set as active within the first `UL`. The second list is displayed `sub_topic_categories` with the first list element (as seen on the browser) set to active via hard-coded HTML. When I say Click on `A` I want `active` removed from the list element `G` and then added to `A`. This must only affect this `sub_topic_category` list.

I hope I have explained this well. At the moment I have

    $('#topic_categories li ul.sub_topic_categories li.active').removeClass('active');

which works but it removes the active elements found in the `Type3` sub_topic_categories list as well.

I'm trying to modify the TORCS Racing Simulator for a competition at my University. Most of this has already been done, so only parts of what I'm posting is actually my code. But I added some new functions to it and I'm having trouble with them.  

The whole thing worked fine in Linux with g++ but when I try to compile it in Visual Studio 2005, I get an Unresolved external symbol error.

I added a new project to the Solution, which uses functions from other projects.

In this new project I call the function:  

    getisDerbyDuel()
    
which is declared in `raceinit.h`, which I included in the new project.

    #ifndef _RACEINIT_H_
    #define _RACEINIT_H_
    
    #define RACE_ENG_CFG	""config/raceengine.xml""

    extern void ReShutdown(void);
    extern void ReStartNewRace(void * /* dummy */);
    extern void ReAddRacemanListButton(void *menuHandle);
    extern int  ReInitCars(void);
    extern int  ReInitTrack(void);

    extern void ReRaceCleanDrivers(void);
    extern char *ReGetCurrentRaceName(void);
    extern char *ReGetPrevRaceName(void);
    extern bool getisDerbyDuel(void);
    extern void setisDerbyDuel(bool isDerbyDuel);
    
    extern tModList *ReRaceModList;
    
    #endif /* _RACEINIT_H_ */
    
and defined in `raceinit.cpp`:

     bool _isDerbyDuel = true;
    
    void setisDerbyDuel(bool isDerbyDuel) {
    	_isDerbyDuel = isDerbyDuel;
    }
    bool getisDerbyDuel(void) {
    	return _isDerbyDuel;
    }
    
The `raceinit.h` and `raceinit.cpp` are in a different projects in my Solution called client, which compiles without errors. I also added the `client.lib` to the dependencies in my project.  

When compiling I get the following output:

    1>Generating Code...

Any ideas are appreciated, I don't know what to try anymore.

__________________________________________________________________________________________

EDIT:

Thanks for your answers. I tried changing the external thing, so the flag itself is declared external in the header file and the getter is not (and several combinations) but nothing seems to change the error output.

I'm not exactly sure what is meant by exporting the functions. A quick Google search lead me to this:

    [..]
    extern void ReRaceCleanDrivers(void);
    extern char *ReGetCurrentRaceName(void);
    extern char *ReGetPrevRaceName(void);
    #ifdef __cplusplus
    extern ""C"" {  // only need to export C interface if
                  // used by C++ source code
    #endif
    extern bool __declspec( dllimport ) getisDerbyDuel(void);
    extern void __declspec( dllimport ) setisDerbyDuel(bool isDerbyDuel);
    
    #ifdef __cplusplus
    }
    #endif
    extern bool _isDerbyDuel;
    [...]

and

    extern ""C"" {
    #include <raceinit.h>
    }

Which changed the error Output to this:

    1>championship2010server.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol     __imp__getisDerbyDuel referenced in function ""void __cdecl drive(int,struct CarElt *,struct     Situation *)"" (?drive@@YAXHPAUCarElt@@PAUSituation@@@Z)
    1>.\Release/championship2010server.dll : fatal error LNK1120: 1 unresolved externals

I just don't know whats wrong here.

___________________________________________________________________________________________

EDIT TWO:

So, after reading up on importing/exporting functions I adjusted my code.  
The header file, where the unresolved function is declared now looks like this:  

    #ifdef __cplusplus
    extern ""C"" {  // only need to export C interface if
                  // used by C++ source code
    #endif
     __declspec( dllexport ) bool getisDerbyDuel(void);
     __declspec( dllexport ) void setisDerbyDuel(bool isDerbyDuel);
    
    #ifdef __cplusplus
    }
    #endif
    extern bool _isDerbyDuel;
    
The file where I call the function doesn't have a header file, but I tried to declare the imported function according to the other functions in the file:  
    
    [...]
    static tTrack *curTrack;
    static int RESTARTING[NBBOTS];
    
    static void initTrack(int index, tTrack* track, void *carHandle,
    		void **carParmHandle, tSituation *s);
    static void newrace(int index, tCarElt* car, tSituation *s);
    extern ""C"" void drive(int index, tCarElt* car, tSituation *s);
    static void endrace(int index, tCarElt *car, tSituation *s);
    static void shutdown(int index);
    static int InitFuncPt(int index, void *pt);
    
    __declspec( dllimport ) bool getisDerbyDuel(void);
    [...]
    

The header is included just like any other and the function is called like this:

    if (getisDerbyDuel()) {
    [...]
    
The error output now changed to this:

    error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol _getisDerbyDuel referenced in function _drive

So it seems to me that if I just solved some C/C++ compatibility issue (or made it worse, I'm not even sure anymore) but the linker problem remains unchanged.

2727233,,"This is a perfect use case for a custom filter! I am first going to describe a method that is not the quickest way, but it is probably the cleanest and easiest to understand for anyone else who might have to read your code. I will also describe a 'dirtier' way that should do the job if you are in a time crunch.

**Quick Way:**

The place to find where this is displayed is in the file:

    /wp-content/plugins/woocommerce/templates/single-product/add-to-cart/variable.php

Around line 27, depending on your version of WooCommerce, you will see something like this line:

    <option value=""""><?php echo __( 'Choose an option', 'woocommerce' ) ?>&hellip;</option>

The __() function is running the first parameter through WordPress's translation system using the 'woocommerce' text domain. It is best to preserve the possibility for translation, so we will want to change this text before we send it through the translation function. 

This line of code happens during a loop that outputs all of the product variation attributes. This allows us to easily see which attribute is being output by looking at the **$name** variable.

We will need to make a function that takes in the $name variable and outputs a string based on it. It would look something like this:

    function get_text_for_select_based_on_attribute($attribute) {
	
	// Find the name of the attribute for the slug we passed in to the function
	$attribute_name = wc_attribute_label($attribute);
	
	// Create a string for our select
	$select_text = 'Select a ' . $attribute_name;
	
	// Send the $select_text variable back to our calling function
	return $select_text;
    }

Now, before the code on line 27 of variable.php, we can put something like this:

    <?php 
    
      $select_text = get_text_for_select_based_on_attribute($name);
    
    ?>

Then, simply swap out 'Choose an option' with your $select_text variable:

    <option value=""""><?php echo __( $select_text, 'woocommerce' ) ?>&hellip;</option>

Don't forget to do this all in a template override or your customization will be lost on the next update!

http://docs.woothemes.com/document/template-structure/

**Cleaner Way:**

A better and more extensible way of doing this is to add a custom filter to pass this through. It's a few extra steps, but allows you to easily add further custom logic if you want to override the functionality on a case-by-case basis depending on your product. 

First, make a custom filter with a semantically-meaningful name, and put it somewhere in your functions.php file for the theme:

    
    add_filter('variable_product_select_text', 'get_text_for_select_based_on_attribute', 10, 1);

Then, in the variable.php file, instead of just calling the function directly, pass it through your new filter:

    $select_text = apply_filters('variable_product_select_text', $name);

Setting up custom filters for things like this does take a little bit longer, but you get the advantage of maintainability, since you can stack or turn off functions down the road without needing to further modify your existing code.

**Update for WC 2.4**

Version 2.4 of WooCommerce introduces a different way of getting attributes and their associated selects. Since they still have not provided a filter for this, I would recommend overriding the wc_dropdown_variation_attribute_options function using the methods described above. So copy and paste the entire function into your theme's functions.php file starting at the declaration, and add a variable for the select text if it's not a color or size:

    //Don't include the if(!function_exists(...) part.
    
    wc_dropdown_variation_attribute_options($args = array()) {
      // Uses the same function as above, or optionally a custom filter
      $select_text = get_text_for_select_based_on_attribute($args['attribute']);
      
      wc_dropdown_variation_attribute_options( $args = array() ) {
        $args = wp_parse_args( $args, array(
            'options'          => false,
            'attribute'        => false,
            'product'          => false,
            'selected'         => false,
            'name'             => '',
            'id'               => '',
            'class'            => '',
            'show_option_none' => __( $select_text, 'text-domain' ),
            'show_option_color' => __( 'Choose a color', 'text-domain' ),
            'show_option_size' => __( 'Choose a size', 'text-domain' )

Out of interest, can the case aspect be set in advance somehow, but without making permenant changes to the `name` attribute or doing so in a temporary copy of the `view_items` list?

For example I tried using a lambda within a lambda which I didn't think would work and, guess what, it didn't. Although unexpectedly the syntax was accepted (no exceptions), it just didn't result in any sorting being actually performed.

Look the android:shrinkColumns and android:stretchColumns properties of your table. You can edit this properties using:

    setColumnShrinkable(int columnIndex, boolean isShrinkable)
    setColumnStretchable(int columnIndex, boolean isStretchable)

It should work using this methods (I've not tested).

1343576,,"The title of your question as well as the phrasing suggests you are trying to use UDP sockets like TCP.

###TCP and UDP are different protocols###

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol. Clients connect to servers, and a given server will have one socket per connection, plus one for listening. The network stack of the operating system routes incoming packets to the listening socket or the proper connected socket.

UDP is connectionless. **Your program will only have one UDP socket**. It will receive all UDP packets to the given port. You cannot spawn a process and get it to listen on the same port. **So you can not *have more udp listeners on same port*, which is what you asked for.**

###Considering the Erlang implementation###

The common design pattern for TCP is to have one process handling the listening socket, spawning new worker processes for each connected sockets.

Since you try to implement something similar with UDP, you need to perform what the network stack does for you with TCP. You could have one process receiving packets and forwarding them to the proper worker process, spawning if required, based on source port and IP address. This process should maintain a table of all active ""connections"", i.e. all alive ""streams"" of packets.

Please also note that there is no close mechanism with UDP, so you should rely on timeouts, and maybe an additional mechanism in your protocol.",Just making sure the answer I was looking for was more visible,,2,41778.66544,,,98,41501.68826,25,717,0,,"Uppsala, Sweden","<p>Working as a web-developer at an Uppsala based company.</p>

",,41861.39435
3486544,,"How to handle authentication in a RESTful Client-Server architecture is a matter of debate.

Commonly, it can be achieved, in the SOA over HTTP world via:

- HTTP basic auth over HTTPS;
- Cookies and session management;
- Token in HTTP headers (e.g. *OAuth* 2.0);
- Query Authentication with additional signature parameters.

You'll have to adapt, or even better mix those techniques, to match your software architecture at best.

Each authentication scheme has its own PROs and CONs, depending on the purpose of your security policy and software architecture.

**HTTP basic auth over HTTPS**

This first solution, based on the standard HTTPS protocol, is used by most web services.

    GET /spec.html HTTP/1.1
    Host: www.example.org
    Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==
 
It's easy to implement, available by default on all browsers, but has some known draw-backs, like the awful authentication window displayed on the Browser, which will persist (there is no LogOut-like feature here), some server-side additional CPU consumption, and the fact that the user-name and password are transmitted (over HTTPS) into the Server (it should be more secure to let the password stay only on the client side, during keyboard entry, and be stored as secure hash on the Server).

We may use [Digest Authentication](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617), but it requires also HTTPS, since it is vulnerable to [MiM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) or [Replay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack) attacks, and is specific to HTTP.


**Session via Cookies**

To be honest, a session managed on the Server is not truly Stateless.

One possibility could be to maintain all data within the cookie content. And, by design, the cookie is handled on the Server side (Client in fact does even not try to interpret this cookie data: it just hands it back to the server on each successive request). But this cookie data is application state data, so the client should manage it, not the server, in a pure Stateless world.

    GET /spec.html HTTP/1.1
    Host: www.example.org
    Cookie: theme=light; sessionToken=abc123

The cookie technique itself is HTTP-linked, so it's not truly RESTful, which should be protocol-independent, IMHO. It is vulnerable to [MiM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) or [Replay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack) attacks.

**Granted via Token (OAuth2)**

An alternative is to put a token within the HTTP headers, so that the request is authenticated. This is what *OAuth* 2.0 does, for instance. See [the RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-7):

     GET /resource/1 HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.com
     Authorization: Bearer mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM

In short, this is very similar to a cookie, and suffers to the same issues: not stateless, relying on HTTP transmission details, and subject to [a lot of security weaknesses](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819) - including MiM and Replay - so is to be used only over HTTPS.

**Query Authentication**

Query Authentication consists in signing each RESTful request via some additional parameters on the URI. See [this reference article](http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2009/12/principles-for-standardized-rest-authentication.html). 

It was defined as such in this article:

> All REST queries must be authenticated by signing the query parameters
> sorted in lower-case, alphabetical order using the private credential
> as the signing token. Signing should occur before URL encoding the
> query string.

This technique is perhaps the more compatible with a Stateless architecture, and can also be implemented with a light session management (using in-memory sessions instead of DB persistence).

For instance, here is a generic URI sample from the link above:

    GET /object?apiKey=Qwerty2010

should be transmitted as such:

    GET /object?timestamp=1261496500&apiKey=Qwerty2010&signature=abcdef0123456789

The string being signed is `/object?apikey=Qwerty2010&timestamp=1261496500` and the signature is the SHA256 hash of that string using the private component of the API key.

Server-side data caching can be always available. For instance, in our framework, we cache the responses at the SQL level, not at the URI level. So adding this extra parameter doesn't break the cache mechanism.

See [this article](http://synopse.info/files/html/Synopse%20mORMot%20Framework%20SAD%201.18.html#TITL_98) for some details about RESTful authentication in our client-server ORM/SOA/MVC framework, based on JSON and REST. Since we allow communication not only over HTTP/1.1, but also named pipes or GDI messages (locally), we tried to implement a truly RESTful authentication pattern, and not rely on HTTP specificity (like header or cookies).

In practice, the upcoming [MAC Tokens Authentication for OAuth 2.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-http-mac-05) may be a huge improvement in respect to the ""Granted by Token"" current scheme.

**Conclusion*****

It's worth concluding that REST is not only HTTP-based, even if, in practice, it's mostly implemented over HTTP. REST can use other communication layers. So a RESTful authentication is not just a synonym of HTTP authentication, whatever Google answers. It should even not use the HTTP mechanism at all, but shall be abstracted from the communication layer.",In a simple way authentication is a third party user data credentials using JSON Web Token,,2,42136.56361,,,1,43088.29083,1,0,0,,India,,,43097.6491

I'm still trying to achieve the same thing stated in the question above. Basically my code now looks like this:

    for(int ac = 0; ac < gravityObject.length; ac++) {
	  gravField[ac].setVector(0,0);
	  System.out.println(ac);
	  for(int ad = 0; ad < gravityObject.length; ad++) {
        System.out.println(ad);
		if(ac != ad) {
          gravField[ac].increaseBy(gravityObject[ac].aDueToGravity(planetMass[ad],
                                                                   position[ad],
                                                                   position[ac]));

        } else {
          //do nothing
        }
          
        gravField[ac].print();
      }
    }

It gives me the correct values for gravField[ac], but only if I reset gravField[ac] to zero. So comment out the gravField[ac].setVector(0,0) and it doesn't work. It starts adding gravField[0] to gravField[1]. 

Say gravField has length 2. Then the intermediate values printed by gravField[ac].print() are correct, but they don't actually get stored! Instead at the end, it just sets gravField[0], gravField[1] and gravField[2] all equal to gravField[2], which is the only value not to get reset.

So this error seems to be a permission issue. First please double check if you have assigned sufficient permissions such as add in  the group **contributors** . Besides check if you have got any deny permission for getting files. In TFS, deny trumps allow.

To do this, web access, go to settings->source control:

 1. Add yourself as a user (if you aren't there already)
 2. Verify that you do not have any deny permissions
 3. If you do, use the Why? link to trace the culprit

[![Example][1]][1]

Don't worry, as long as you don't change the permissions for your user nothing will be saved.
 

If all of you including administrator still can't do this, please pay attention to your [license][2].

[Makery's blog][2] has some minimal 3rd party documentation of the sandbox dialogs, including basic usage examples as well as a backport of the dialog portion to JavaFX 2.2.

For an iOS app, in Swift:

    theImageView.tintColor = UIColor.redColor()

----------
**Watchkit**   
In WatchKit for Apple Watch apps, you can set the [tint color for a template image][1], as of Xcode 6.2 beta 4. 

 1. You must add your image to an Asset Catalog in your WatchKit App, and set the image set to be rendered as a Template Image in the Attributes Inspector. Unlike for an iPhone app, you cannot set the template rendering in code in the WatchKit Extension at present.
 2. Set that image to be used in your WKInterfaceImage in interface builder for your app
 3. Create an IBOutlet in your WKInterfaceController for the WKInterfaceImage called 'theImage'...

To then set the tint color in Swift:

    theImage.setTintColor(UIColor.redColor())

To then set the tint color in Objective-C:

    [self.theImage setTintColor:[UIColor redColor]];

If you use a template image and do not apply a tint colour, the Global Tint for your WatchKit app will be applied. If you have not set a Global Tint, `theImage` will be tinted light blue by default when used as a template image.

Not all conversions are possible, though, and you may need to write special case logic if you want to support conversions from types that are not `IConvertible`.

The corresponding code (without exception handling or special case logic) would be:

    Ship ship = new Ship();**strong text**
    string value = ""5.5"";
    PropertyInfo propertyInfo = ship.GetType().GetProperty(""Latitude"");
    propertyInfo.SetValue(ship, Convert.ChangeType(value, propertyInfo.PropertyType), null);

2410634,,"Hopefully this will be an easy question for some of you. So I am working on some code to interface with a heater controller. The GUI is written mostly in Kivy language (to compartmentalize the various screens), but I have a .py file that ties all the Kivy files together. Within one my Kivy files, there are a few TextInput fields that are for a user to define a few numerical values. Once the text fields are filled, the user clicks on the ""Start"" button to begin the heater test. 
Now, my question is when using the ""Start"" button as my flag, how can I get Python to read the numerical values that are in the fields? I've looked online and posts about using the .*get* and *raw_input* methods, but nothing that has Python retrieving and interpreting values from Kivy code. Any help would be much appreciated!

This is part pf my .py file, which where I need the user-input values to be evaluated...

    class ControllerScreen(Screen):

    def build(self):
        return ControllerScreen()

    def CreateExcelFile(self):
            wb = Workbook()
            ws = wb.active
            ws.cell('A1').value = 'Timestamp'
            ws.cell('B1').value = 'Temperature'
            ws.cell('C1').value = 'Batch 1'
            ws.cell(row=2, column=1).value = 000
            wb.save(""Spreadsheet1.xlsx"")
 
This is an excerpt from the Kivy file, containing the code for a single text field that a user types a number into...

    <ControllerScreen>:
        TextInput:                                    #Ramp time increment field
            id: ramp_time

            size_hint: 0.1,0.06

3.

Now, problem is (𝛼_1 λ_2-𝛼_2 λ_1).

(𝛼_1 λ_2-𝛼_2 λ_1) becomes 0

Is that true??

    a2 = mu(2)/(mu(1)+mu(2));

    x = exprnd(mu(1), [1, n]);
    y = exprnd(mu(2), [1, n]);

The figure is pdf of Z=𝛼_1 * X + 𝛼_2 * Y.

This case is λ_1 = 1, λ_1=2. (The red line is gamma distribution.)

I thought to :

1) Reshape the A matrix into a 2 x 320 000 matrix so I get the four cells I need to average next to each other and it is easier to deal with the row number afterwards.

    Im4bis=reshape(permute(reshape(Im4,size(Im4,2),2,[]),[2,3,1]),2,[]);

2) Create a cell-array with the 4 cells I need to average (subsetted) and calculate the mean of it. That's where it doesn't work

    I{1,160000}=ones,
    for k=drange(1:2:319999)
        for n=1:160000
            I{n}=mean2(Im4bis(1:2,k:k+1));
        end
    end

I created an empty matrix of 400 x 400 cells (actually a vector of 1 x 160000) and I wanted to fill it with the mean but I get a matrix of 1 x 319 999 cells with one cell out of 2 empty.

1430418,,"    public function linkable()
    {
        return $this->morphTo(null, App::make($this->linkable_type));
    }

This will not work in any case, because `morphTo()` in [Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model][1]
expects 

 1. The **name** of the polymorphic relationship ('linkable')
 2. The **type** of the object to be morphed ('Page', not an instance of `Page`)
 3. The **id** of the object to be morphed

If they are not provided, Laravel is smart enough to guess them and then accordingly return a `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\MorphTo` object.

Also, `$this->linkable_type` and `$this->linkable_id` should actually not be `null` in that context.

Let's have a quick look at the relevant part of the `morphTo()` function:

    $instance = new $class;
    
    return new MorphTo(
        $instance->newQuery(), $this, $id, $instance->getKeyName(), $type, $name
    );

> **Note**: This is the code from version 4.2.6, the code linked above seems to be from a later version and is slightly different and the function returns a `BelongsTo` instead of a `MorphTo` object.

The problem is specifically the `$instance = new $class;` - the class is simply instanciated and not resolved. But you can just grab that part of the magic and handle it yourself:

    public function linkable()
    {
        $instance = App::make($this->linkable_type);

      	$id = 'linkable_id';
		$type = 'linkable_type';
		$name = 'linkable';

		return new MorphTo(
			$instance->newQuery(), $this, $id, $instance->getKeyName(), $type, $name
		);
    }

This should actually work (haven't tested it), but I'm not sure about any side effects it might cause in some edge cases.

Or maybe you could also just override the whole function in your `MenuItem`-model and just adjust the relevant part:

    public function morphTo($name = null, $type = null, $id = null)
    {
    	if (is_null($name))
    	{
    		list(, $caller) = debug_backtrace(false);
    
    		$name = snake_case($caller['function']);
    	}
    
    	list($type, $id) = $this->getMorphs($name, $type, $id);
    
        //eager loading
    	if (is_null($class = $this->$type))
    	{
    		return new MorphTo(
    			$this->newQuery(), $this, $id, null, $type, $name
    		);
    	}

        // normal lazy loading
    	else
    	{
            // this is the changed part
    		$instance = \App::make($class); // new $class;
    
    		return new MorphTo(
    			$instance->newQuery(), $this, $id, $instance->getKeyName(), $type, $name
    		);
    	}
    }

The relationship would then be as usual:

    public function linkable()
    {
        return $this->morphTo();
    }

3219165,,"I'm working in Sterling B2B Integrator and I have to create a Business Process to collect only the files from ""yesterday"" (the previous date) The problem is that B2Bi doesn't have a service to do that and the colection directory has over than 7000 files, so I can't use a GetDocInfo service to collect the dates into tags because the Sterling may colapse.

So, I decided to use the Command Line Adapter to invoke a script that would do that for me. The problem is that the script doesn't work either:

    set var1=%1       /* UNC File Path */
    
    set var2=%2       /* Source directory */
    
    set var3=%3       /* ""yesterday"" date */
    
    set var4=%4       /* save the list of files into a .txt*/
    
    set var5=%5       /* copy the files from yesterday into this directory */

    PUSHd **%var1%** & 
    forfiles /p **%var2%** /s /C  "" cmd /c echo @path @FDATE | findstr /m **%var3%**"" > %var4% & 
    for /f %%a in (**%var4%**) do copy %%a **%var5%** &

Function: The script should collect the files from yesterday and save them into a specific directory.

    Example: PUSHd ""\\emea\e801\Public"" & 
    forfiles /p _AppData\CAMS\PDFS\Digital\CertificadoCancelado /s /C  "" cmd /c echo @path @FDATE | findstr /m ""27/07/17"""" > _Shared\_AppData\MFT\BackupSterling\temp_puente_PRO\Lista_DIGCRT02\ficherosAyer.txt & 
    for /f %%a in (_Shared\_AppData\MFT\BackupSterling\temp_puente_PRO\Lista_DIGCRT02\ficherosAyer.txt) do copy %%a _Shared\_AppData\MFT\BackupSterling\temp_puente_PRO\Lista_DIGCRT02\DIGCRT02 &

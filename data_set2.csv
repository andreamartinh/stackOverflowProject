We have been using node-sdk to deploy, invoke, and query transactions on Bluemix. 
Currently, we are facing an error on Bluemix when I call, invoke, or query function for the first time. The error says `internal_metadta error.` But if I call the functions for a second time, it works correctly. After some time (say 10 minutes) if we again call this function, it gives the same error.


Problem is similar to [38893402][1]

As you can see I have to call **ST_GeomFromText**  postgis function on `INSERT` for geom column value. This geom column is a string value from the view of the ADO.NET but it can't be set as a text on INSERT.

I think ADO.NET automatically format my INSERT command this way:

    INSERT INTO mygeotable (id, name, geom) VALUES (1, ""MyName"", **""ST_GeomFromText('POINT(755888.4156 112458.556)', 23700)""**)

What I am trying to achieve is to find contours arround features such as:

- light areas
- dark areas
- grey1 areas
- grey2 areas
- etc. until grey-n areas

(The number of areas shall be a parameter of choice)

I do not want to take a simple binary-threshold but rather use some sort of contour-finding (for example watershed or other). The major feature-lines shall be kept, noise within a feature-are can be flattened.

The result of my code can be seen on the images to the right.

Unfortunately, as you can easily tell, the colors do not really represent the original large-scale image features! For example: check out the two areas that I circled with red - these features are almost completely flooded with another color. What I imagine is that at least the very light and the very dark areas are covered by its own color.

I know it's not perfect, but it contains stuff for administrating, as well as a default install of a MySQL DB.

On the other hand, if you feel adventurous (not a big deal):

- You can try [MySQL][2] as a standalone package.
- My advice would be to use [MySQL Workbench][3] as well; it's a very good GUI tool for MySQL administration.

However, you should take some SQL training beforehand. It'll give you a clear view of what can and can not be done with it, and help you avoid some common mistakes.

[Wikipedia][4] is a good start for that to give you an idea.

Yes, this will take memory.

Is it a problem though? Only you can say. It depends how often it happens, and whether there's any better alternative. Is there some reason why it *needs* to be declared to return `object` instead of `double`? Is it going to be assigned to an `object` type variable anyway (in which case the boxing's going to happen regardless)?

Boxing is one of those performance concerns which is *real*, but [often exaggerated][1]. If it's happening hundreds of thousands of times per second in your app, that's probably significant. If it's happening hundreds of times per hour, your concern should be more about whether the API is *appropriate* than the performance cost.

26622,,"Hello,

While upgrading a Windows Forms application from the .NET 1.1 framework to the .NET 3.5 framework, I have an issue with the `RSACryptoServiceProvider`. In a database I have stored binary files which contains an encrypted signature (SHA1 hash) and I have a public key stored in the filesystem as a text document containing a hexadecimal string. I have no issues in reading the file from the filesystem and getting the public key coded in a certificate.

From the public key I get the modules and exponent field as part of the public key. I assign these values to a new instance of the `RSAParameters` object. Next I create a new instance of the `RSACryptoServiceProvider` class and call the `ImportParameters`. In that call the 3.5 code throws an exception. Note that the 1.1 code has no issues at all.

Does anyone know if the byte arrays given to the properties of the RSAParameters needs to be converted, so I can use them in the 3.5 code also? I already tried to reversing the array or converting the byte array to BigInteger, but that is not solving my problems.

For reference the full stacktrace:

    System.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicException: Bad Data.

Any of the SRK_ and MRS may have multiple DMN values (given in File_B). What I actually want in my File_C is all the possible pairing of the values of SRK_ and MRS belongs to one row of File_A. For example the first row in File_A is SRK_00017	MRS10904.1 and if we will look at File_B SRK_00017 has three DMN values (DMN03028.10, DMN03029.10, DMN00069.20) and the MRS10904.1 also has two DMN values (DMN02113.10 and DMN00659.13).

I was under the impression that all of the alias are encapsulated by this instance? Am I wrong? Did I somehow lost my first alias?

Also if I do something like:

    Criteria criteri2 = criteria.createAlias(""tier"".tier);

Does this mean that both `criteria` and `criteria2` point are the same `Criteria` or diff and which one points to what alias?

http://jayrambhia.wordpress.com/2012/06/25/configuring-boostpython-and-hello-boost/

It turns out that you do not need to use bjam at all. A makefile suffices. I will repeat the the solution from the above link here:

1.) Install the libboost-python package

2.) Create a hello world source file called 'hello_ext.c':

    char const* greet()
    {
        return ""hello, world"";
    }

    #include<boost/python.hpp>
    BOOST_PYTHON_MODULE(hello_ext)
    {
       using namespace boost::python;
       def(""greet"",greet);
    }

3.) Create a makefile:

    PYTHON_VERSION = 2.7
    PYTHON_INCLUDE = /usr/include/python$(PYTHON_VERSION)
    # location of the Boost Python include files and library
    BOOST_INC = /usr/include
    BOOST_LIB = /usr/lib
    # compile mesh classes
    TARGET = hello_ext
    $(TARGET).so: $(TARGET).o
		g++ -shared -Wl,--export-dynamic $(TARGET).o -L$(BOOST_LIB) -lboost_python -L/usr   /lib/python$(PYTHON_VERSION)/config -lpython$(PYTHON_VERSION) -o $(TARGET).so
    $(TARGET).o: $(TARGET).c
		g++ -I$(PYTHON_INCLUDE) -I$(BOOST_INC) -fPIC -c $(TARGET).c

4.) make

    make

5.) Ready to use. In python:

    import hello_ext
    print hello_ext.greet()

Now if i press the next or previous button, it changes the pages, and also the pictures from the page (i have 9 pictures, a 3x3 matrix of image views)
When i scroll to the second page, sometimes it changes the pictures, sometimes it doesnt, and also  the viewpager starts to get crazy, sometimes i cannot go back to the first page, from the second, but i can scroll to the right, a unlimited number of times, but everytime it shows the second page. Whan can i do. Or is it possible to make the Viewpage not be scrollable, so i could only change the pages from the buttons?",Improved formatting,,1,2/15/13 16:00,"Viewpager changes the pictures from page 1 to page 2 , by pressing button, but does not by sliding",<android><scroll><imageview><android-viewpager><adapter>,1030,2/15/13 15:39,26,154,0,http://cochibo.com,San Francisco Bay Area,,qingu,2/15/13 16:00,

I have a table inside a div.  I want the table to occupy the entire width of the div tag.

In the CSS, I've set the width of the table to 100%.  Unfortunately, when the div has some margin on it, the table ends up wider than the div it's in.

I need to support IE6 and IE7 (as this is an internal app), although I'd obviously like a fully cross-browser solution if possible!

If you would like to run Scala native in IntelliJ (I shifted to IntelliJ and still can't get my hands down) you need to make sure a few things are in order. Most of this happens under File -> Project Structure (and when you get a hang of it it is much more logical than Eclipse) which requires you to create a project. I am assuming you already did this. I am also assuming you have selected a jdk, but this can also be done in the Project Structure.

Now, to Scala:

 1. Make sure you have the Scala plugin. Close all the projects (File -> Close Project) and return to the starting screen. Here you can see a link to the plugins at the top right, or click the ""Configure"" button, then the ""Plugins"" button. A simple search for scala should find the plugin.
 2. Import Scala as a library in File -> Project Structure -> Global Libraries. Click the plus sign, select Java (Scala is Java), browse to your scala-dir (which can be downloaded here: http://plugins.intellij.net/plugin/?id=1347) and select the _lib_ directory. Press ok and you should see the library popping up on the list.
 3. Make sure the _facet_ (Scala framework) is in place. Goto File -> Project Structure -> Facets. Click on the plus-sign and find Scala. A sublink should appear (if not double-click the Scala link). Clicking the sublink make sure you have selected a compiler before continuing. This should be provided by the modules selected before. I normally use FSC (Fast Scala Compiler) but it's probably a good idea to test the basic settings before experimenting.
 4. Make sure the Scala Module is in place. In Project Structure -> Modules click on the plus icon and select Scala. Again be sure to select a compiler library.
 5. If you want to, setup configurations",(minor edit) corrected typo,,2,12/25/12 0:19,,,16880,8/9/12 8:45,1956,647,44,,,"<h2>To make me answer a question</h2>

     * @param  initialCapacity the initial capacity

    }

there is an extra parameter `accessOrder`. Based on this, a newly added object will be moved to the end of the list (`accessOrder - true`) or remain at the old location (`accessOrder - false`).


In order to create a `Set` with these characteristics, you would need to use this factory method from `java.util.Collections`: `newSetFromMap(LinkedHashMap(initialCapacity, loadFactor, accessOrder))`

Keep in mind that the `accessOrder` property is responsible for **all** interactions with given element - if you'd call `get` on `HashMap` it will do reordering as well (that shouldn't affect you anyway because the `Set` interface does not expose a `get` method on a wrapped `HashMap`, just saying).",Corrected spelling and grammar.

I'm using VS2013 and zmq 3.2.4. In order to not 'lose' messages in my pubsub framework [aside: I believe this is a design flaw. I should be able to start my subscriber first, then publisher and I should receive all messages] I must synchronise the publisher with the subscriber a la [durapub/durasub](http://zguide.zeromq.org/cpp:durapub) etc. I am using the durasub.cpp and durapub.cpp examples found in the zeromq guide. 
If I use the examples as-is, the system works perfectly. 

If I now add scoping brackets around `ZMQ_PUSH` in durasub.cpp

    {
		zmq::socket_t sync (context, ZMQ_PUSH);
		sync.connect(syncstr.c_str());
		s_send (sync, ""sync"");
	}

the system stops working. The matching 'ZMQ_PULL' signal never reaches the application level in durapub.cpp.


I have stepped through the C++ wrapper to check the return values from `zmq_close` and all is well. As far as ZMQ is concerned it has delivered the message to the endpoint.
Hopefully I've done something obviously stupid?


There's more. The addition of 
    
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(1));

allows the system (ie the pub/sub) to start working again. So it's clearly a race-condition, presumably in the reaper thread as it destroys the socket. 

More digging around. I think LIBZMQ-179 refers to the problem as well.

998781,,"I have a user settings page where users can change the settings of the application. The users can input a number between 0 and 10. See screenshot: http://oi43.tinypic.com/2uerazp.jpg

Now I would like to transform the input fields into a range slider using the CJuiSliderInput widget of the yiiframework: http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/api/1.1/CJuiSliderInput#maxAttribute-detail

I cannot seem to get the code working, this is the current code in view: 

    <?php foreach($settings as $i=>$value): ?> 
        <?php $setting=UserSetting::model()->findByPk($value->setting_id); ?> 
        <h4><?php echo CHtml::encode($setting->label); ?></h3> 
        <?php echo CHtml::activeTextField($value,""[$i]value""); ?>
    <?php endforeach; ?>

I would like to replace the activeTextField with 

    $this->widget('zii.widgets.jui.CJuiSliderInput',array(
        'model'=>$model,
        'attribute'=>'[$i]value',
        'maxAttribute'=>'timeMax',
        // additional javascript options for the slider plugin
        'options'=>array(
            'range'=>true,
            'min'=>0,
            'max'=>10,
        ),
    ));

What values do I need to fill in to the widget to get it to work? Each textField input is from a different model btw. 

The controller looks something like this(don't know if you need it): 

    $settingsvalues = UserSettingValue::model()->findAll('client_id=:id', array(
        ':id' => $id,                       
    ));                  
    if(isset($_POST['UserSettingValue'])){   
        $valid = true; 
        foreach($settingsvalues as $i=>$value){
            if(isset($_POST['UserSettingValue'][$i]))
                $value->attributes = $_POST['UserSettingValue'][$i]; 
            $value->save(); 
            $valid = $value->validate() && $valid; 
        }
        if($valid)
            $value->save(); 
    }
    $this->render('settings',array(
        'model' => $model, 
        'settings' => $settingsvalues,
    ));

In storyboard label has fixed font size, word wrapping setting is `NSLineBreakByWordWrapping`. 

In cases, when first word is longer than line width my code doesn't work (for iOS 8).

E.g. for ""Verylongline 45"" in iOS 7.1 `boundingRectWithSize:` will calculate `rect` for line (w:50, h:60):

    Verylongl
    ine
    45

It keeps width bounds but makes word wrap after first word anyway. In iOS 8 it returns rect for text (w:50, h:40):

    Verylongl
    ine 45

Because or that difference code to calculate acceptable font size doesn't work. iOS 8 can fit much bigger font in 2 lines, ignoring wrap setting.

This code is a category method to adjust font size for label to fit it in 2 lines. Works for iOS 7.1, doesn't in iOS 8.0
    
    for (int i = maxSize; i>minSize; i--) {

Note that getMap() is called in `onActivityCreated` and `inflater.inflate(R.layout.map, container, false)` is not necessary if you don´t use a custom layout. 

You don´t even need a map.xml layout!

You are extending `SupportMapFragment` but you are inflating another `MapView` (not the one tied to `SupportMapFragment` by default), that´s why you are not viewing the changes in your map. Because you were acting on the default `View` got from `getMap()` but you are viewing another. See the [docs about getMap()][1]: 

>     public final GoogleMap getMap ()
> Gets the underlying GoogleMap that is tied to the view wrapped by this

`mvn archetype:generate....`

`mvn compile`

I got failed message such as: `maven unable to locate javac compiler`.  

On my computer, I have default jre install at *c:\program files\java\jre.1.6*.
And I have the other *c:\java\jdk1.6* and `JAVA_HOME` set to this *c:\java\jdk1.6*. 

I don't see anything wrong with my setting.  After searching, I decided to look into `mvn.bat`, I echoed `%JAVA_HOME%` every step  and it displays correctly as `C:\java\jdk1.6` but when I run the command : `mvn --version`, it displays Java home: *c:\program files\java\jre1.1.6*.

Finally, I found out that I just need to set `-Djava.home=c:\java\jdk1.6` as in the command below, and working fine now: 

`%MAVEN_JAVA_EXE% %MAVEN_OPTS% -classpath %CLASSWORLDS_JAR% ""-Dclassworlds.conf=%M2_HOME%\bin\m2.conf"" ""-Djava.home=%JAVA_HOME%"" ""-Dmaven.home=%M2_HOME%"" %CLASSWORLDS_LAUNCHER% %MAVEN_CMD_LINE_ARGS% `

use `FShellBrowser` in:

Another problem with this code is:
How to communicate to Explorer that the form is resized and you want to resize the hosted Explorer.

718487,,"You don't override a module, you override (or, more properly, <code>rewrite</code>, see below) a class that belongs to a module, or belongs to the general <code>lib</code> folder.

Based on your wording, I assume by override you mean ""taking a class from <code>app/code/core/*</code>"" and placing it in ""<code>app/code/local/*</code>""?  If that's the case then you mostly can't.  Code pools work because magento adds four paths to the PHP include path.

    app/code/local
    app/code/community
    app/code/core
    lib

Then, when the autoloader says

    include('Mage/Module/Path/To/File.php');

if will first check the <code>local</code> folder, then the <code>community</code> folder, then the <core>core</code> folder, and finally the <code>lib</code> folder.  The <code>local</code> folder always wins.

If your class is a Model, Helper, or Block, I'd suggest using the module based rewrite system. The same techniques you use to rewrite classes in the Core modules can be used to rewrite classes in local or community modules.  The point of a module based system is that the code which runs the core system is inserted / behaves the same way as code other people might add to the system.",formatting,,2,5/15/13 20:40,,,3457,9/30/11 20:32,610,4049,36,,,"<p>A person slowly learning the finer points of various things.</p>

> [How do I prevent CSS inheritance?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/958170/how-do-i-prevent-css-inheritance)  

<!-- End of automatically inserted text -->

Is there a way to declare the CSS property of an element such that it will not affect any of its children or is there a way to declare CSS of an element to implement just the style specified and not inherit any of the style declared for its parents.

A quick example

HTML:

    <body>
        <div id='container'>
            <form>
                <div class='sub'>
                    Content of the paragraph
                    <div class='content'>Content of the span</div>
                </div>
            </form>
        </div>
    </body>


CSS:

<!-- language: lang-css -->

    form div {
        font-size: 12px;
        font-weight: bold;
    }
    div.content {
        /* Can anything go here? */
    }

Under normal circumstances one would expect the The text block ""Content of the paragraph"" and ""Content of the span"" will both be 12px and bold.

What i'm looking for is if there's a property to include in the CSS above in the ""div.content"" block that will prevent it from inheriting the declaration in the ""#container form div"" block to limit the style to just ""content of the paragraph"" and spare ""Content of the span"" including any other children div.

If you are wondering why, well. I created a particular CSS file that give all the forms on my project a particular feel and the divs under the form all inherit the feel. No problem. But inside the the form i want to use Flexigrid but flexigrid inherits the style and it just looks useless. If i use flexigrid outside the form and such it wont inherit the forms css, then it looks great. Otherwise it just looks terrible.

Hi, I have a problem with my unity controlled Motor, I have a Unity scene which contains a Cube, I can slide this cube on x axis, I send the x value through COM3, I get the Value in my Arduino and convert it to an Angle for my motor.

My problem is:
When I move the cube in Unity, my motor rotates but after I slide the cube a couple times, unity freeze like 15 / 20 sec then my motor moves but not at the right angle. 

Can anyone tell me where my problem is? ",typo cleanup,,1,6/29/16 12:06,Arduino and motor controlled with Unity,<c#><unity3d><arduino><serial-port>,77,6/7/13 23:19,39,30,0,,"Bay Area, CA, United States","<p>I write code.</p>

<!-- lang: ruby -->

**Question 1**.  How do I get the Address.create loop to only insert the first member from the array...in this example Diana L Dillard   the ""name"" database field instead of all the names?  Ideally I want to create one field for the first and then another for all others.
.  

**Question 2**. Probably a silly newbie question but why do I get these dashes ""---"" inserted with my data?  I do not want them.

What I want to do is :

1.Check Whether Num2 value is exist or not, If not set to zero.

2.Randomly Generate new numbers 0~100 in num1

3.If num1 is Even, Increase num2 by 1.

4.Save Data and Repeat.

When I clicked the button, It crashes. What could be the reason?

I start the scanner with:

    SonarQube.Scanner.MSBuild.exe begin /k:ProjectKey /n:ProjectName /v:4.0.70 

The end command is

    SonarQube.Scanner.MSBuild.exe end

Start is definively called before end.

* **[GraphUI](https://code.google.com/p/enough/wiki/Graphui)** has a very interesting [demonstration video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT87JfTYIvo), but beware: although it might seem that the graph is being created by clicking and dragging, in reality all editing happens through the keyboard, using shortcuts. On the plus side, contextual instructions are always available showing which shortcuts do what.

The graph editors mentioned in other answers, yEd (a Java application) and JointJS/Rappid (a JaveScript thing) apparently have nothing to do with DOT (tried both).

I believe there exist no working DOT-handling graph editor out there at all.

Here is sample of my database, my task is to merge the `'FirstDate'` and `'LastDate'` of the following row(s) with the same `'RATE'` into a single row.

I've tried to use `ROW_NUMBER()` to group those duplicate `'RATE'` but it also group those rows which are not adjacent to others, so yet I can't merge all of them.

Is it possible for implementing this query without using any if-else or while-loop?

My goal is, upon clicking an item with the colorClick id (already containing a default class of ""white""), to rotate that item between being assigned the class green, yellow, orange, red, and back to white again (ad infinitum).

The CSS is simple - each class simply corresponds to a different background color.

The HTML is simple - a div tag with two CSS classes (one static, one to be changed by jQuery).

The jQuery is simple - read the class on the clicked item, and change it.

No, this is wrong. When you define your memthod to be `const`, you have also specified that all members of the class are also const. This means that, no matter what type the member has in the definition, inside your `result` method they are (at least) `const`. As such, the compiler is completely justified in returning the error it is returning.

The usual (e.g. `C++`) way to resolve this is to define two (or, in D, three) overloads:

<!-- language: lang-d -->

    RefType result() {
        return test[0];
    }
    RefType result() const {
        return test[0];
    }
    RefType result() immutable {
        return test[0];
    }

So, one for the case the class is mutable, which returns a mutable reference. One for the case the class is const, which returns a const reference, and one for the case the class is immutable, which returns an immutable reference.

You will notice, however, that aside from the method decoration, all three implementations are precisely the same. To prevent you from defining three identical implementations, `D` has the `inout` modifier:

<!-- language: lang-d -->

    RefType result() inout {
        return test[0];
    }

This single definition replaces all three of the definitions above. As a rule of thumb, just write your definition as usual, but place `inout` any place you'd otherwise place `const`.",enabled syntax highlighting,,2,5/30/16 0:51,,,576,8/16/11 16:19,65,60,8,https://maaaks.me/,"Nizhny Novgorod, Russia",,Max Alibaev,5/30/16 0:51,

But when the bar should become red, only the buttons which the mouse hovers over become red:

[![IncorrectToolstrip][2]][2]

I would like the whole toolstrip the be red-colored at once.

I already tried changing `e.AffectedBounds` to `e.ToolStrip.Bounds`, to no avail.

**UPDATE**: Solution (Thanks to FSDaniel comment):

By adding `Invalidate()` to the end of the `OnRenderToolStripBackground` the toolstrip did indeed become fully red but also caused the application to go into a infinite loop. I solved this by creating an event that was triggered by changing the `UnSaved` property. The form that has the toolstrip then subscribed a method to this event which called `toolstrip.Invalidate()`.

}


So my question is double: 

1- In an Android Activity are the methods called sequencially from the first line to the last one?, Is there a loop that makes the ""pointer"" go back to the first line once the last one is reached?

2-How can you determine which methods are going to be executed automatically (like onCreate() ) and which are going to wait until they are called by another method of the script.

How to design the classes for interaction with things? Lets say I have these classes:

    cUser() // for all user actions
    cSession() // for interactions with session data.
    cAnotherObject // multiple another objects from future modules

Should I somehow extend them all, so in the end, I end up with one object like this:

[cSession extends cDb, cUser extends cSession ... etc.]

One way of implementing the filter would be to define custom Managers for your models, with a `for_user` method that takes the User as an argument: something like:

    class ForUserManager(models.Manager):
        def for_user(self, user):
            return self.filter(user=user)

Now you can use this manager - subclassed and/or with a mixin as necessary - on all your models, and remember to use `objects.for_user(request.user)` everywhere.

This will make testing easier too - your test could monkeypatch that `for_user` method so that it sets a flag or a counter in a global variable somewhere, and then test that it has incremented as expected.

**Edit in response to comment** No, as you suspect, that won't work. It's not even that everyone will necessarily get the last-logged-in user: it's that Managers are class-level attributes, and as such are reused throughout a process, so any request served by that server process will use the same one.",added link to south,,2,5/1/13 21:16,,,55,10/18/11 8:15,9,29,0,,,,Jan Salvador van der Ven,5/1/13 21:16,

 - If you must use the given version of `Glassfish` and the given version
   of `org.jboss.logging` without replacing the `jar` file as you did, you
   can try to configure application specific `jar` usage in the glassfish
   server. Check the following:
   http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E18930_01/html/821-2418/gatej.html#scrolltoc
   
 - You could also change the `org.jboss.logging` version of the file you use so that it matches the one inside glassfish. The version inside glassfish is probably going to be updated soon, or there could also be a good reason that it is not included. 

While it is of course worth studying the class loading mechanisms of glassfish or any server and gain knowledge to precise control what libraries are used. From a strategic point of view, given the fact that the `org.boss.logging` version is something that will probably change with a next version of glassfish with no effort from your side and that normally logging is not so crucial to your application I would advice not to put much effort into this task and just use the version provided by glassfish.

3286405,,"KingCrunch is right -- the proper way to setup such environment is to use `<VirtualHost>` directive in Apache config file.

If, for whatever reason this needs to be dona via rewrite and .htaccess .. then you need **mod_rewrite** to be enabled and .htaccess files to be allowed to contain rewrite rule (`AllowOverride` directive).

Here are the rules:

    Options +FollowSymLinks -MultiViews
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteBase /

    # rule #1
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} =www.foo.com
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/website1/
    RewriteRule (.*) /website1/$1 [L]
    
    # rule #2
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} =www.bar.com
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/website2/
    RewriteRule (.*) /website2/$1 [L]

This code is to be placed in .htaccess file in root folder. If placed elsewhere (e.g. configuration or virtual host context) some tweaking may be required.

Fist rule is for `www.foo.com` and second for another domain name. These rules are pretty much the same. We tell Apache to check domain name (via `{HTTP_HOST}` request variable), and if it matches our domain rewrite (internal redirect) URL into one folder deeper. The second condition is to prevent a rewrite loop (to not to rewrite already rewritten URL). It is necessary as Apache, after executing rewrite, goes to the next rewrite iteration (that is how it works), and this condition is required to stop the loop.

For both read and write, the object element has already been written, so you don't need to add an outer element in write. For example, you can just start reading/writing attributes in the two.

For [write][2]:

I'll agree that is a little unclear, but it boils down to ""it is your job to `Read()` the end-element tag of the wrapper"".

The user needs to click the submit button on the form once they are done with the task to submit the HIT and receive their payment.  I have tried sending the form with more and with less information, I have tried hard coding the information (of the user currently testing the HIT) to the form, I have tried using a hyperlink with the user data, and I have tried submitting the task from different users, from different computers, from different networks, and so on.

Any assistance on this error will be greatly appreciated.

Edit:

I have tried what Thomas has said but I still get the same error message.  My form now looks like this:

    <form name=""hitForm"" id=""hitForm"" action=""https://workersandbox.mturk.com/mturk/externalSubmit"" method=""POST"">

And yes, I am working on the requester sandbox to make sure my entire HIT works properly before opening it to the regular Mechanical Turk.

2320810,,"Some solutions (to the more general question ""how to share values between C and LD script?""):

1) (NOTE: for this solution I'll assume that you are using a recent version of GNU ld, docs here : http://www.math.utah.edu/docs/info/ld_3.html)

You can associate an absolute value to a symbol inside the script by defining it outside the section compounds (e.g. at the very begin of the script). Than you can import the symbol in C by defining it as extern. Beware that the value you need in C is the ADDRESS of the symbol:

Script:

    StackSize = 0x00003000 * 4; /* the size */
    .co_stack : {  
        _fstackptr = ORIGIN(ram) + LENGTH(ram) - 4;
        _fstacksize = StackSize;       
        . = (_fstackptr - _fstacksize);
        *(.co_stack .co_stack.*)
    }

C:

    extern long StackSize;
    #define STACK_SIZE (((size_t)&StackSize)/sizeof(long))

This solution may impose restrictions in the use of the value obtained, e.g. most compilers will not accept a line like this:

    long my_stack[STACK_SIZE];

but you don't need it anymore, since you can define the symbol ""my_stack"" inside the script and import it as ""extern long my_stack[];"". I think that it's an acceptable limitation anyway.

2) Another way is to define in the script two symbols located at the start and at the and of the section and import them as ""extern char"" in C. The size of the section in bytes is the difference of their two addresses. This solution has the same limitation of (1)

3) If your linker is not smart enough, you can use the C preprocessor to produce a suitable script at compilation time by expanding the macro STACK_SIZE as in C. You have to

  a) create the file ""stacksize.h"" containing

    #define STACK_SIZE 0x3000

  b) Add the line #include ""stacksize.h"" at the beginning of the script and use STACK_SIZE whenever you need. Save the script as ""ldscript.c"".

  c) in your makefile (or equivalent compilation procedure) invoke the preprocessor. If you have GCC the command is:

    gcc -P -E ldscript.c -o ldscript.ld

Please note that some gcc versions give a special meaning to the input file's extension. So I suggest to use "".c"", it's the safest way.

  d) Use the file ""ldscript.ld"" produced by the C preprocessor as link script

This is my server

    import socket

The idea is that the server just prints all the data that was sent from the client. As you can see, I intended to encode the message strings as bytes with utf-8. But I never came that far.

With the server script running, I typed the client lines one by one into an IDLE python shell. After the third line, this error prompted up. Since I'm German, this is a vague translation. The error message will probably sound different if you can reproduce the error

How can I solve this error ? The server is slightly adapted, but the client is the exact code from the tutorial. And the error seens rather strange, after all I want the socket to be already connected - with the server . At first I thought that somehow there were already sockets connected to my server but restarting it and typing the client code again lead to the same result.

308627,,"I'm having some difficulty using Ninject's InSingletonScope binding with Web Api RC.  No matter how I create my binding, it looks like perhaps Web Api is handling scope/lifetime instead of Ninject.

I've tried a few variations on wiring up Ninject.  The most common is identical to the answer here:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10849132/mvc4-rc-webapi-binding-with-ninject

I've also tried this version:
http://www.peterprovost.org/blog/2012/06/19/adding-ninject-to-web-api/

In both, I'm literally creating an out of the box Web Api project, then adding the Ninject packages as described in either post.  Finally, I'm adding the Resolver and Scope classes, such as this for the StackOverflow version:

    public class NinjectDependencyScope : IDependencyScope
    {
        private IResolutionRoot resolver;

        internal NinjectDependencyScope(IResolutionRoot resolver)
        {
            Contract.Assert(resolver != null);

            this.resolver = resolver;
        }

        public void Dispose()
        {
            IDisposable disposable = resolver as IDisposable;
            if (disposable != null)
                disposable.Dispose();

            resolver = null;
        }
        public object GetService(Type serviceType)
        {
            if (resolver == null)
                throw new ObjectDisposedException(""this"", ""This scope has already been disposed"");
            return resolver.TryGet(serviceType);
        }

        public IEnumerable<object> GetServices(Type serviceType)
        {
            if (resolver == null)
                throw new ObjectDisposedException(""this"", ""This scope has already been disposed"");
            return resolver.GetAll(serviceType);
        }
    }

and:

     public class NinjectDependencyResolver : NinjectDependencyScope, IDependencyResolver
    {
        private IKernel kernel;

        public NinjectDependencyResolver(IKernel kernel)
            : base(kernel)
        {
            this.kernel = kernel;
        }
        public IDependencyScope BeginScope()
        {
            return new NinjectDependencyScope(kernel.BeginBlock());
        }
    }

Then, NinjectWebCommon looks like this:

    using System.Web.Http;
    using MvcApplication2.Controllers;
    
    [assembly: WebActivator.PreApplicationStartMethod(typeof(MvcApplication2.App_Start.NinjectWebCommon), ""Start"")]
    [assembly: WebActivator.ApplicationShutdownMethodAttribute(typeof(MvcApplication2.App_Start.NinjectWebCommon), ""Stop"")]
    
    namespace MvcApplication2.App_Start
    {
        using System;
        using System.Web;
    
        using Microsoft.Web.Infrastructure.DynamicModuleHelper;
    
        using Ninject;
        using Ninject.Web.Common;
    
        public static class NinjectWebCommon
        {
            private static readonly Bootstrapper bootstrapper = new Bootstrapper();

                DynamicModuleUtility.RegisterModule(typeof(NinjectHttpModule));
                bootstrapper.Initialize(CreateKernel);
            }
    
            /// <summary>

                bootstrapper.ShutDown();
            }
    
            /// <summary>
            /// Creates the kernel that will manage your application.
            /// </summary>

            private static IKernel CreateKernel()
            {
                var kernel = new StandardKernel();
                kernel.Bind<Func<IKernel>>().ToMethod(ctx => () => new Bootstrapper().Kernel);

                RegisterServices(kernel);
    
                // Set Web API Resolver
                GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.DependencyResolver = new NinjectDependencyResolver(kernel);
    
                return kernel;
            }
    
            /// <summary>
            /// Load your modules or register your services here!
            /// </summary>
            /// <param name=""kernel"">The kernel.</param>
            private static void RegisterServices(IKernel kernel)
            {
                kernel.Bind<ILogger>().To<Logger>().InSingletonScope();
            }
        }
    }


The ILogger and Logger objects don't do anything, but illustrate the issue. Logger does Debug.Writeline so that I can see when it was instantiated.  And each refresh of the page shows that it's being refreshed per call, rather than the singleton I'd hoped for.  Here is a controller using the Logger:

    public class ValuesController : ApiController
    {
        private readonly ILogger _logger;
        public ValuesController(ILogger logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
            _logger.Log(""Logger created at "" + System.DateTime.Now.ToLongTimeString());
        }
        // GET api/values
        public IEnumerable<string> Get()
        {
            return new string[] { ""value1"", ""value2"" };
        }
        // GET api/values/5
        public string Get(int id)
        {
            return ""value"";
        }
        // POST api/values
        public void Post(string value)
        {
        }
        // PUT api/values/5
        public void Put(int id, string value)
        {
        }
        // DELETE api/values/5
        public void Delete(int id)
        {
        }
    }

When I put trace information into the creation of the kernel, it seems to show that the kernel is only created once.  So... what am I not seeing?

How can this be accomplished? Is it true that I am supposed to use `wp_query()` and avoid `query_posts()`?
Also, will I need to reset with `wp_reset_postdata();` for this loop in `index.php` ?

I have read codex and googled around, but still am not confident with altering the Loop.


I thought the code below would work but I get White Screen of death in WordPress Themes 2012 and 2013. I replaced the code in `index.php` with

**Edit:**

White Screen of Death was due to a missing `?>` elsewhere in my `index.php` file. Noob mistake. But now I am having issues with pagination. Page 2 displays the same posts as page 1. What could be wrong?

My code for pagination inside `functions.php`

    if ( ! function_exists( 'my_pagination' ) ) :
   	    function my_pagination() {
		    global $wp_query;
		    $big = 999999999; // need an unlikely integer

We would like to traverse the list[ [score, progress, points ] ] and output the ""max(score), max(progress), max(points)"" of this list.

Any idea how we can do it in a more efficient way ?

However, the `equals` method can be overridden - so two distinct objects can still be equal.

For example:

    String x = ""hello"";
    String y = new String(new char[] { 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' });

    System.out.println(x == y); // false
    System.out.println(x.equals(y)); // true

Additionally, it's worth being aware that any two equal *string constants* (primarily string literals, but also combinations of string constants via concatenation) will end up referring to the same string. For example:

    String x = ""hello"";
    String y = ""he"" + ""llo"";
    System.out.println(x == y); // true!

Here `x` and `y` are references to the same string, because `y` is a compile-time constant equal to `""hello""`.

     

     String x  = ""hello"";
     String y1 = ""he"";
     String y  =  y1 + ""llo"";

N means size of the data. But in case where where `data` is a single number you need to define what you understand as size of data. The value of a number or length of it's representation.

IMO the algorithm is `O(N)`. Because in this problem of counting 1 in binary representation IMO relevant size of data is length of the number's representation, not it's value i.e. the length of the bit stream. And obvious worst case is all 1's taking N iterations.

But if you consider value of N as size of the data, it's representation has `log(N)` length so you can say it's `O(log(N))`

PS Also big O notation makes sense only if you generalise algorithm for arbitrary high Ns. In this code N is limited by int size, so you can say it's O(1) as it will be at most 64 loop iterations (for 64 bit ints)",Basic formatting,,2,42682.59785,,,3878,41689.374,388,253,104,,"Zürich, Switzerland","<p>I create fun stuff.

It's actually possible to register a custom class as `RKResponseMapperOperation` data source :

    #import ""MyCustomDataSource.h""
    #import ""PRManagedObjectMappingOperationDataSource.h""

    [RKManagedObjectResponseMapperOperation registerMappingOperationDataSourceClass:[MyCustomDataSource class]];

`MyCustomDataSource` should implement the `RKMappingOperationDataSource` protocol.
Mine inherits from `RKManagedObjectMappingOperationDataSource` since I'm using managed objects through Core Data.

    @interface SUManagedObjectMappingOperationDataSource : RKManagedObjectMappingOperationDataSource

2963831,,"Yes! Place your cursor on the comment you would like to wrap and press **Alt+Q**. If you throw off the wrap with an edit, just press Alt+Q again.

# Background

There's a command called `wrap_lines` which has the capability to to exactly what you want. `wrap_lines` is defined in `Packages/Default/paragraph.py`, line 112, and is sparsely documented at [the Unofficial Docs' list of commands](https://sublime-text-unofficial-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/commands.html):

> **wrap_lines**  
> Wraps lines. By default, it wraps lines at the first ruler’s column.
>
> * width [Int]: Specifies the column at which lines should be wrapped.

`wrap_lines` is already accessible via the items located in the `Edit -> Wrap` menu. There are options to wrap the paragraph in which the cursor lies at column 70, 78, 80, 100, and 120, as well as the first ruler. By default, `Wrap Paragraph at Ruler` is mapped to `Alt+Q` on Windows and `Super+Alt+Q` on OSX.

# Working with Rulers

What do I mean by the *first* ruler? You might summon a ruler via `View -> Ruler`, but if you want more than one on-screen (or would rather have your rulers in writing), you can add a JSON array of integers—each of which defines a ruler—to any `.sublime-settings` file. The array I've added to my user preferences file, for example, looks like this:

    ""rulers"":
    [
        79,
        80,
        72
    ],

Thanks to that first ruler rule, `Alt+Q` will wrap a line that's longer than 79 characters at the 79-column mark, even though there's a ruler ""before"" it at column 72. ""First ruler"" **doesn't mean the leftmost ruler**, but the **first defined ruler**. If I moved `80,` to index 0 like I have below, then the lines would wrap at 80 columns instead. Likewise for `72`.

    ""rulers"":
    [
        80,
        79,
        72
    ],

# Using a Key Binding

Rulers are for the weak, you say? You can also write a new [key binding](https://sublime-text-unofficial-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/key_bindings.html) to wrap a line at a column of your choice! Just add something like this to your `Preferences -> Key Bindings – User` file:

    { ""keys"": [""alt+q""], ""command"": ""wrap_lines"", ""args"": {""width"": 80} },

Removing the `args` object would instead wrap at the first ruler, like the `Wrap Paragraph at Ruler` command does. `Wrap Paragraph at Ruler` is actually defined just like that in the default Windows keymap file:

    { ""keys"": [""alt+q""], ""command"": ""wrap_lines"" },

# Caveats

One of the best (and, in some cases, worst) things about the `wrap_lines` command is that it will detect any sequence of non-alphanumeric characters that begins the line and duplicate it when wrapping. It's great for writing comments, since the behavior that your example suggested does indeed happen:

    # This is a super long message that has too much information in it. Although inline comments are cool, this sentence should not be this long, because having to scroll to the right to finish reading a comment is really annoying!

Becomes:

    # This is a super long message that has too much information in it.
    # Although inline comments are cool, this sentence should not be this
    # long, because having to scroll to the right to finish reading a
    # comment is really annoying!

But if the line happens to start with any other symbols, like the beginning of a quote, Sublime Text doesn't know any better than to wrap those, too. So this:

    # ""This is a super long message that has too much information in it. Although inline comments are cool, this sentence should not be this long, because having to scroll to the right to finish reading a comment is really annoying!""

Becomes this, which we probably don't want:

    # ""This is a super long message that has too much information in it.
    # ""Although inline comments are cool, this sentence should not be this
    # ""long, because having to scroll to the right to finish reading a
    # ""comment is really annoying!""

It's a good idea to be careful with what starts your original line. Also, the `wrap_lines` command **targets the entire paragraph that your cursor is touching**, not just the current line nor, surprisingly, only the working selection. This means that you can use the command again on a newly-wrapped series of lines to re-wrap them at a different column, but you might also end up wrapping some lines that you didn't want to—like if you're aligning a paragraph under a header in Markdown:

    # Hey, this header isn't really there!
    Be careful with what starts the original line. Also, the `wrap_lines` command **targets the entire paragraph**, not just the current line.

If the command is activated anywhere within that block of text, you'll get this:

    # Hey, this header isn't really there! Be careful with what starts the
    original line. Also, the `wrap_lines` command **targets the entire
    paragraph**, not just the current line.

You can avoid this sort of issue with clever use of whitespace; another empty line between the header and the paragraph itself will fix the wrapping, so:

    # Hey, this header isn't really there!

    Be careful with what starts the original line. Also, the `wrap_lines` command **targets the entire paragraph**, not just the current line.

Becomes:

    # Hey, this header isn't really there!

    Be careful with what starts the original line. Also, the
    `wrap_lines` command **targets the entire paragraph**, not just
    the current line.

Since the operation is so fast, you shouldn't have much trouble with tracking down the causes of any errors you encounter, starting over, and creatively avoiding them. Sublime Text *usually* doesn't have any trouble with mixing together comments and non-comments in code, so if you're lucky, you won't ever have to worry about it!","I had to read several paragraphs to get the desired answer. alt-Q is really all you need to know unless you want to do special tweaking, so it should be at the very beginning.",,2,41433.16212,,,1,42485.08162,2,0,0,,,,Andrew Nutter,,42774.07676

When the intent-A is called and you are responding back to user, at that time you will use that code. Basically instead of `dialogAction` type `Close` we are using `ConfirmIntent`.  
You can read more about response format [here][1].

**Complete code:**

        return {
            ""dialogAction"":{
                ""type"":""Close"",

        }
        
    def perform_action_A(intent_request):
    	source = intent_request['invocationSource']
        output_session_attributes = intent_request['sessionAttributes'] if intent_request['sessionAttributes'] is not None else {}

> How to call a lambda function from a intent and what is the code
> format in javascript?

I have not coded any lex bot in javascript, maybe [this link][2] might help you.

**Test Event Code:**

    {
      ""currentIntent"": {
        ""name"": ""intent-A"",
        ""slots"": {
        }
      },
      ""invocationSource"": ""DialogCodeHook"",
      ""sessionAttributes"": {},
      ""bot"": {
        ""name"": ""Your_Bot_Name""
      },
      ""userId"": ""Some_User_Id""
    }

For Fulfillment change the value of `invocationSource` to `FulfillmentCodeHook`. Also, give the slots if there are any.

Just to clarify, `configure test events` is used for testing the Lambda code by simulating a request. You can directly integrate the Lambda function with Lex and test using Lex console.

Hope it helps.

**Edit 1:** Updated the answer with code.  
**Edit 2:** Updated test events code.

This is probably the easiest solution but it will either change the aspect ratio or leave black boxes below/above or left/right of your screen when the game is run on device that has different aspect ratio than 1.5 (480/320). I think currently most devices have 1.66 aspect ratio (800/480).

This will allow any object that claims to be equateable to WholeNumber to be passed into the WholeNumber's Equals(object) function and get the desired result without WholeNumber needed to know about any other class.

Without giving away the product idea, we have several hundred `form schemas` paired with their return functions which are called when the form is submitted. The `schemas` are `JSON` objects which dynamically create a form on the client side. When the data in the form is submitted the linked functions may do a variety of different things with that data.

Currently these form schemas and linked functions are hosted in a private repo on `github`. Is this the best way to go or could they be persisted in a database such as `mongodb`?

You have to explicitly import a function in order to extend it.

So this would work: 

    import Base.push!
    
    function push!(base :: Node, child :: Node)
       push!(base.children, child)
    end

As per [Matt B.'s comment][1] below, you can also be explicit when declaring the new method:

    function Base.push!(base :: Node, child :: Node)
       push!(base.children, child)
    end

which avoid separating the `import` statement from the declaration.

It works, sends me the details I want etc etc.  BUT!!!

When I click a link, It fires off the details to me via Ajax, then it's meant to ""click"" the event again, which it does!  but the event does not fire it's normal action.  So When clicking a link to another page, I would go to that other page... that's not happening.

If I comment out the line event.preventDefault();  Then the event fires as I would expect...

So to me it looks like the event.preventDefault is executing even though it's not meant to be during the second call...

Sorry if this is a bit complicated to understand. I don't quite understand what's happening myself.
Is it possibly a bug, or is there something that I've done that has caused this?

When the country is selected from this listbox the selection changed event fires.
Here another linq query is ran to match the selected CustomerID with CustomerID's in an order table. This also works fine.
Now. Here's the problem. If I change selection from the first country I get the error Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

2499031,,"I have a library which is being used by customer and they are passing `DataRequest` object which has `userid`, `timeout` and some other fields in it. Now I use this `DataRequest` object to make a URL and then I make an HTTP call using `RestTemplate` and my service returns back a JSON response which I use it to make a `DataResponse` object and return this `DataResponse` object back to them.

Below is my `DataClient` class used by customer by passing `DataRequest` object to it. I am using timeout value passed by customer in `DataRequest` to timeout the request if it is taking too much time in `getSyncData` method.

	public class DataClient implements Client {

		private final ExecutorService service = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);

			DataFetcherTask task = new DataFetcherTask(key, restTemplate);
			Future<DataResponse> future = service.submit(task);

			return future;
		}

		// how to set socket timeout value by using `key.getSocketTimeout()` instead of using hard coded 400
		private ClientHttpRequestFactory clientHttpRequestFactory() {
			HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory requestFactory =

				RequestConfig.custom().setConnectionRequestTimeout(400).setConnectTimeout(400)
					.setSocketTimeout(400).setStaleConnectionCheckEnabled(false).build();
			SocketConfig socketConfig =

			PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager poolingHttpClientConnectionManager =

			poolingHttpClientConnectionManager.setDefaultMaxPerRoute(200);

			CloseableHttpClient httpClientBuilder =
				HttpClientBuilder.create().setConnectionManager(poolingHttpClientConnectionManager)
					.setDefaultRequestConfig(requestConfig).setDefaultSocketConfig(socketConfig).build();

			requestFactory.setHttpClient(httpClientBuilder);
			return requestFactory;
		}		
	}

`DataFetcherTask` class:

	public class DataFetcherTask implements Callable<DataResponse> {

		private DataRequest key;
		private RestTemplate restTemplate;

		public DataFetcherTask(DataRequest key, RestTemplate restTemplate) {
			this.key = key;
			this.restTemplate = restTemplate;
		}

		@Override
		public DataResponse call() throws Exception {
			// In a nutshell below is what I am doing here. 
			// 1. Make an url using DataRequest key.
			// 2. And then execute the url RestTemplate.
			// 3. Make a DataResponse object and return it.
			
			// I am calling this whole logic in call method as LogicA
		}
	}

Customer within our company will use my library like this as shown below by using my factory in their code base - 
 
	// if they are calling `getSyncData()` method
	DataResponse response = DataClientFactory.getInstance().getSyncData(key);
	
	// and if they want to call `getAsyncData()` method
	Future<DataResponse> response = DataClientFactory.getInstance().getAsyncData(key);

I am implementing `sync call as async + waiting` since I want to throttle them with the number of threads otherwise they can bombard our service without any control.

**Problem Statement:-**

I am going to add another timeout variable called ""socket timeout"" in my `DataRequest` class and I want to use that variable value `(key.getSocketTimeout())` in my `clientHttpRequestFactory()` method instead of using hardcoded 400 value. What is the best and efficient way to do that? Right now I am using Inversion of Control and passing `RestTemplate` as a contructor to share the RestTemplate between all my Task objects. I am confuse now how to use `key.getSocketTimeout()` value in my `clientHttpRequestFactory()` method.

My problem is that I'm unsure how to pass the variables, if I need to concatenate them in one single object (using the `scipy.optimize.curve_fit` function) ; and also, if I can fit the the data in one go, without separating and fitting separately the real and imaginary part.


Edit: after playing a bit with `curve_fit` it does seem that it take complex numbers in or functions in the complex plane. I guess that or I'll have to fit separately (I'm bothered about how to treat my two sets of fit parameters then, or lost information/precision in there) or using another tool.

The function to be fitted looks like this:

    def func3((var1,var2),amp,exp,spin): 
        return amp*var1**exp*N.exp(1j*spin*var2) 

where var1,var2 are the parameters of interest, amp,exp are fixed and spin is the independent variable (which is complex).

and I was trying to fit using:

    curve_fit(func3,(d,a),r+1j*i)

This policy removes an existing ""telnet"" client. 

That local policy worked fine. So I wanted to use the policy on my policy server which then should push it to the clients after 5 minutes. This does not work.

These are the steps I did on the policy server:
Step1: Create a file remove_packages.cf in the /var/cfengine/masterfiles directory


    bundle agent remove_packages
    {
      methods:
          ""telnet""  usebundle => package_absent(""telnet"");
    }

Step2: vi promises.cf in the /var/cfengine/masterfiles directory and add 

    body common control
    
    {
    
          bundlesequence => {
               remove_packages,

Step3: vi promises.cf in the /var/cfengine/masterfiles directory and add 
  

      inputs => {
                # JF 15/08/2014 remove telnet package
                      ""remove_packages.cf"",
    
          };

Step4: Check on mistakes

    root@ubuntu:/var/cfengine/masterfiles# cf-promises ./promises.cf 

Step5: Wait 5 minutes until it replicates to the clients..

Here nothing happens at the clients ... As you can see it is still present:

    root@ubu14client:~# which telnet
    /usr/bin/telnet

Can somebody explain why it does not work?",Remove signature,,1,41927.10435,CFEngine policy not executed on Ubuntu nodes,<ubuntu><policy><cfengine>,3526,40161.82902,105,1284,21,,,,Ed I,,41927.10435

    <uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED"" />

Also, in your manifest, define your service and listen for the boot-completed action:
<application ....>
    <service android:name="".MyService"" android:label=""My Service"">
    	<intent-filter>
    		<action android:name=""com.myapp.MyService"" />
    	</intent-filter>
    </service>
    
    <receiver
    	android:name="".receiver.StartMyServiceAtBootReceiver""

    	android:exported=""true""
    	android:label=""StartMyServiceAtBootReceiver"">
    	<intent-filter>
    		<action android:name=""android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED"" />
    	</intent-filter>
    </receiver>

</application>

Then you need to define the receiver that will get the BOOT_COMPLETED action and start your service.

    public class StartMyServiceAtBootReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
    
    	@Override
    	public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
    		if (""android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED"".equals(intent.getAction())) {
    			Intent serviceIntent = new Intent(""com.myapp.MySystemService"");
    	        context.startService(serviceIntent);
    		}
    	}
    }

3102824,,"Instead of using the `*ngFor` in the `<tr>` or `<td>`, use it in `<template>` and depending on the `index` or amount of records found you could chose to render `<td>` or `<tr>`.

Follow this tutorial/guide that explains this exact thing: https://toddmotto.com/angular-ngfor-template-element

Rememeber to use `<ng-template>` for Angular v4 or `<template>` for Angular v2.

At the end, you could have something like:

    <ng-template ngFor let-i=""index"" let-c=""count"" let-contact [ngForOf]=""contacts | async"">
        <tr *ngIf=""if((i % 4) == 0)"">
            // Check if index is multiple of 4
        </tr>
    </ng-template>

This final example is the final code of the tutorial/guide I linked you. I used it so when you get to this point you have a friendly code.

**Option 2:**

Using `<template>` you could build a directive to render the data.

So you would have something like:

    <template [myDirective]=""myData""></template>

And in your `myDirective` logic you chose how to render data using an index within the data loop.

**Option 3 - @Pipe:**

The `@Pipe` could be the right one! You could try something like this:

    @Pipe({
        name: 'renderTable'
    })
    class RenderTable {
        transform(content) {
            let template = ``;
            let index = 0;
            for (let row in content) {
                let currentTemplate = ``;
                if (index === 0) {
                    // check if first record
                    currentTemplate = `
                        <tr>
                            <td>${row}</td>`;
                } else if ((index % 4) === 0) {
                    // check if multiple of 4
                    currentTemplate = `
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                        <td>${row}</td>`;
                } else {
                    // normal row
                    currentTemplate = `
                        <td>${row}</td>`;

Artist websites are rendered via `<a href=""$Website"" target=""_blank"">`. The problem is that the URLs are being appended to the base URL of the website, so we end up with something like:

`<a href=""mysite.com/www.artistsite.com"" target=""_blank"">`

instead of the desired:

`<a href=""www.artistsite.com"" target=""_blank"">`

However, if `$Website` includes the protocol (http or https) then the link works as expected. So if `$Website` is `http://www.artistsite.com` then we get:

`<a href=""http://www.artistsite.com"" target=""_blank"">`

This site contains hundreds, and eventually thousands, of client-maintained artist records. Ideally the client would be able to paste in URLs without having to worry about appending http or https to each one.

If you wanted to do dependency injection into your Razor templates (no matter if is _Layout or some other view) you could define your custom page base type:

    public abstract class MyWebViewPage<T> : WebViewPage<T>
    {
        public MyWebViewPage()
        {
            // Padel: I don't think it is ok to do this, calling the container explicitly
            // if the view is created by the container the IFoo is injected also.
            SomeDependency = DependencyResolver.Current.GetService<IFoo>();
        }

        public IFoo SomeDependency { get; private set; }
    }

then in `~/views/web.config` you set the base type:

    <pages pageBaseType=""AppName.Controllers.MyWebViewPage"">

and then all your templates will have the `SomeDependency` property available:

    @model MyViewModel
    @SomeDependency.FooBar()

Notice though that this might not be a good design choice in some situations. If you intend to inject some custom HTML helper to your view then it is OK. But if you intend to inject some domain service and have your views start fetching dependencies from left and right instead of using view models, then you are doing a serious design mistake because a view's responsibility is not to fetch dependencies. Its responsibility is to display the information that it is passed under the form of a view model. Where this information comes from is not the view responsibility. It is the controller to coordinate the fetching of the data and putting it into the view model that is passed to the view.

Version-ing
----------
Versions are huge in node, you could have a bad version and sh*t will hit the fan. 

There is an exceptional [VERSION Saving][1] github topic which comes to mind. 

If this is not the issue, you still need to keep in mind that its not a strongly types lang, that includes the versioning. 

Each situation is different.
----------------------------

 https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/3417

This issue 'FIX' will kill a lot of users who have been using the previous(minor) version. 
You need to be be specific with versioning. (i use this as an example)

You will hit a lot of version issues with Node, as good as it is, unless you specify the version, it will get the latest version. 

So, working on your local (3 months of hard sexy labor) machine means nothing unless in your packages you have a version specified. 

Your server will only have the latest version. 

From the question.. It can only BE a versioning problem. 

**Update from author (ewizard):**
As Pogrindis and I discussed this morning...there is an error in the node logs on openshift when a request is supposed to happen. It says in the node logs that it is an Express error...and we realized that the global version for npm on openshift was using 3.2.5, while the seed I am using uses express v4.2.0 (and that is what I use globally, locally). I am in the process of downgrading my local, global express npm to 3.2.5 to see if this corrects the problem...but +1 to Pogrindis for teaching me about Node Version Manager...as well as having to possibly sync the versions of any npm package that is installed globally on Openshift! Will keep everyone posted to make sure this resolves the problem!

I tried placing 'word-wrap: break-word' even on the label but that doesn't seem to break the label's sentence either.

I did see in the documentation to 'Wrap labels and controls in .form-group for optimum spacing.' but I cannot use 'form-group' i think if I want to use bootstrap divs to control grid/form layout of the labels/answers separately (the labels/inputs are more mobile friendy and expand to 100% of the screener when on xs screens, but on sm+ screen the labels show up left of the input to save screen space).

Here is an example... Expand the jsfiddle's right side frame very big and then you see the form labels get placed on the left with right text-alignment and the issue occuring then.

2017862,,"For future users of JMS I will answer my own question.

It was really hard to find any information as it's not explained in JMS documentation.

I found a lot of people asking how to do it but never had any answer. That's because it's not releated to JMS but to Java.

So here it goes : 

If you want to use a same classe (object) like 

    ObectToSend yo = (ObectToSend) myMessage.getObject();

My first object (yo) is from the class ObectToSend.java in the package com.test.jms and my second object (myMessage.getObject() ) is from the package com.test.jms2. So I have an exception like ""notfoundclass"". And cannot cast objects.

The class ObectToSend.java should be in both projects. But you can't just copy paste with the same name (what I stupidly did). 
You need to create a jar of the class used in both projects/packages and add it to both projects.

That way you use EXACTLY the same class and not a copy of it. And your 2 objects are exactly the same.

1827799,,"I think basically the same idea holds as in the earlier question.  You want to count the number of done record strictly before any given done record.  This gives you a group identifier that can then be used for aggregation.

In SQL Server 2012+, you would use the cumulative sum functionality.  In earlier versions, you can do the same thing with a correlated subquery or outer apply.

This version modifies your above in several ways.  In particular, it simplifies the logic of defining `grp`.  I don't easily see how `row_number()` fits into the query.  I do understand the logic -- enumerate the done actions and use that for aggregation.  But, getting that value on all the rows in the group is non-trivial.

    SELECT r.Key, a.CYCLE_BEGIN_DATE, a.CYCLE_END_DATE, a.NUM_ACTIONS_IN_CYCLE
    FROM Records r LEFT OUTER JOIN
         (select a.key, a2.grp, min(Date) as CYCLE_BEGIN_DATE,
                 max(case when Action = 'Done') then Date end) as CYCLE_END_DATE,

2799839,,"The following CSS rule disables resizing behavior for [`textarea`][1] elements:

    textarea {
        resize: none;
    }

To disable it for some (but not all) `textarea`s, there are a [couple of options][2].

To disable a specific `textarea` with the `name` attribute set to `foo` (i.e., `<textarea name=""foo""></textarea>`):
  
    textarea[name=foo] {
        resize: none;
    }

Or, using an `id` attribute (i.e., `<textarea id=""foo""></textarea>`):

    #foo {
        resize: none;
    }

Or, using a class attribute (i.e., `<textarea class=""foo""></textarea>`):

    .foo {
        resize: none;
    }

The [W3C page][3] lists possible values for resizing restrictions: none, both, horizontal, vertical, and inherit:

    textarea {
      resize: vertical; /* user can resize vertically, but width is fixed */
    }

Review a decent [compatibility page][4] to see what browsers currently support this feature. As Jon Hulka has commented, the dimensions can be [further restrained][5] in CSS using max-width, max-height, min-width, and min-height.

This way you can check to see if the value passed in is `null` or not provided with a blank string `""""`.  If both of those checks pass, you should have a handle on your data you need.  The else is going to handle your case where no input was passed in, so you print your error message, or whatever else you need to do to handle that ""error"".

If you want to go a little more in depth on ensuring you have a number (so users don't enter `""ASDFETC""` as values, you can add further checks in.  Once you verify the `value` is not null and has some ""value"", you can run something like...

    public static boolean isNumeric(String str)  
    {  
      try {double d = Double.parseDouble(str);}  
      catch(NumberFormatException nfe) {return false;}  
      return true;  
    }

You could have something a little more structured to validate that input which would check first if it has substance, then check if it is a number.  Something like this...

    //PSEUDO CODE
    boolean isValidInput = false;
    if( value != null && !value.equals("""")){

Instead of using '`connect`', try using '`watch`'. There are loads of things you can watch.  'value' will get you your pure value changes, but if you listen to 'item' changing, you'll get given the full old and new item, from which you can retrieve your item id.


e.g.

See this Link:[https://stackoverflow.com/a/29160289/2386700][1]

It really depends on what is causing the slow load. If it's because of CSS or images, etc, you may be able to skip those using a similar approach. 

Browser profiles allow you to use browser extensions. Extensions can execute their code both before and after the document loads. That's how they can change how it loads. 

Not sure if there are already extensions for CSS/images as well. But you could always create one.

If the slowness is simply due to the response time of the server itself, then there's not much you can do with Selenium to help that.

To improve the counter, [here][2] you can find a good answer to set the corners rounded

Make sure you have a base model (or interface) of some kind with the following declaration:

    public class BaseModel
    {
        public virtual void OnSaveChanges<T>(T Obj)
        {
            
        }
    }

Add the override in your derived model:

    public class Page : BaseModel
    {
        //property declarations

        public override void OnSaveChanges<T>(T Obj)
        {
            base.OnSaveChanges<T>(Obj);
            Page model = Obj as Page;

            //Do something with the object.
            if (model.Parent_PageID == -1)
                model.Parent_PageID = null;

        }
    }

Add the following into your derived DBContext class:

    public override int SaveChanges()
    {
        foreach (var changeSet in ChangeTracker.Entries())
        {
            var type = Type.GetType(changeSet.Entity.GetType().ToString());
            if (type != null) {
                BaseModel Obj = (BaseModel)Convert.ChangeType(changeSet.Entity, type);
                Obj.OnSaveChanges(changeSet.Entity);
            }
        }            
        return base.SaveChanges();
    }

This will now call `SaveChanges()` for all your models that derive from `BaseModel` which allows you to make any last minute changes. 

Note: Sometimes you could just use the getter or setter of the var but due to the issue I had with Foreign keys, I wasn't able to in this case.

This can be easily adapted to add `AfterSave` events etc.

993883,,"Mike Grassotti's Minimum Viable Ember.js QuickStart Guide
--------

This quickstart guide should get you from __zero to slightly-more-than-zero__ in a couple of minutes. When done, you should feel somewhat confident that ember.js actually works and hopefully will be interested enough to learn more. 

_WARNING: Don't just try this guide then think ember-sucks cause ""I could write that quickstart-guide better in jQuery or Fortran"" or whatever. I am not trying to sell you on ember or anything, this guide is little more than a hello-world._

### Step 0 - Check out jsFiddle

[this jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/mgrassotti/RTK54/) has all the code from this answer

### Step 1 - Include ember.js and other required libraries

Ember.js requires both jQuery and Handlebars. Be sure those libraries are loaded before ember.js:

    <script type='text/javascript' src='//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.js'></script>
    <script type='text/javascript' src=""http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/handlebars.js/1.0.0-rc.3/handlebars.js""></script>
    <script type='text/javascript' src=""http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/ember.js/1.0.0-rc.1/ember.js""></script>

### Step 2 - Describe your application's user interface using one or more handlebars templates

By default ember will replace body of your html page using content of one or more handlbars templates. Someday these templates will be in separate .hbs files assembled by sprockets or maybe grunt.js. For now we will keep everything in one file and use script tags.

First, let's add a single `application` template:

    <script type=""text/x-handlebars"" data-template-name=""application"">
      <div class=""container"">
        <h1>Ember.js is easy?<small> Minimum Viable Ember.js QuickStart Guide</small></h1>
        <p>{{message}}</p>
      </div>
    </script>
    
### Step 3 - Initialize your ember application

Just add another script block with `App = Ember.Application.create({});` to load ember.js and initialize your application.

    <script type='text/javascript'>
      App = Ember.Application.create({});
    </script>

That's all you need to create a basic ember application, but it's not very interesting. 

### Step 4: Add a controller

Ember evaluates each handlebars templates in the context of a controller. So `application` template has a matching `ApplicationController`. Ember creates is automatically if you don't define one, but here let's customize it to add a message property.

    <script type='text/javascript'>
    App.ApplicationController = Ember.Controller.extend({
        message: 'This is the application template' 
    });
    </script>

### Step 5: Define routes + more controllers and templates

Ember router makes it easy to combine templates/controllers into an application. 

    <script type='text/javascript'>
      App.Router.map(function() {
        this.route(""index"", { path: ""/"" });
        this.route(""list"", { path: ""/list"" });
      });

      App.IndexController = Ember.Controller.extend({
        message: 'Hello! See how index.hbs is evaluated in the context of IndexController' 
      });
      
      App.ListRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
        setupController: function(controller) {
          controller.set('content', ['angular.js', 'backbone.js', 'ember.js']);
        }
      });

    </script>
    
To make this work, we modify our the application template by adding an `{{outlet}}` helper. Ember router will render appropriate template into the outlet depending on user's route. We will also use the `{{linkTo}}` helper to add navigation links.

        <script type=""text/x-handlebars"" data-template-name=""application"">
          <div class=""container"">
              <h1>Ember.js is easy?<small> Minimum Viable Ember.js QuickStart Guide</small></h1>
            <p>{{message}}</p>
            <div class=""row"">
              {{#linkTo index class=""span3 btn btn-large btn-block""}}Home{{/linkTo}}
              {{#linkTo list class=""span3 btn btn-large btn-block""}}List{{/linkTo}}
            </div>
            {{outlet}}
          </div>
        </script>
        
        <script type=""text/x-handlebars"" data-template-name=""list"">
          <h3 class=""demo-panel-title"">This is the list template</h3>
          <ul>
          {{#each item in content}}
              <li>{{item}}</li>
          {{/each}}
           </ul>
        </script>

        <script type=""text/x-handlebars"" data-template-name=""index"">
          <h3 class=""demo-panel-title"">This is the index template</h3>
          <p>{{message}}</p>
        </script>

### Done!

A working example of this application is available [here](http://jsfiddle.net/mgrassotti/A4hdE/1/embedded/result/). 

You can use [this jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/mgrassotti/RTK54/) as a starting point for your own ember apps

### Next Steps...

* Read the [Ember Guides](http://emberjs.com/guides)
* Maybe buy the [Peepcode](https://peepcode.com/products/emberjs) screencast
* Ask questions here on Stack Overflow or in ember IRC


_For reference, my original answer:_

> My question is for any Ember.js expert, and certainly the respective tutorial authors: When should I use design patterns from one tutorial, and when from the other?

These two tutorials represent best practices at the time they were written. For sure there is something that can be learned from each, both are sadly doomed to become out of date because ember.js is moving very quickly. Of the two, Trek's is far more current. 

> What components of each are personal preferences, and what components will prove essential as my app matures?
If you are developing a new ember application I would not recommend following the Code Lab approach. It is just too out-of-date to be useful.

> In Code Lab's design, Ember seems to be closer to existing within the application (even though it is 100% of his custom JS), whereas Trek's application seems to live more within Ember.

Your comment is bang-on. CodeLab is making taking advantage of core ember components and accessing them from global scope. When it was written (9 months ago) this was pretty common but today best-practice for writing ember applications is much closer to what Trek was doing.

That said, even Trek's tutorial is becoming out-of-date. Components that were required `ApplicationView` and `ApplicationController` are now generated by the framework itself.

By far the most current resource is the set of guides published at http://emberjs.com/guides/
- they have been written from the ground up over the last few weeks and reflect the latest (pre-release) version of ember.

I'd also check out trek's wip project here: https://github.com/trek/ember-todos-with-build-tools-tests-and-other-modern-conveniences

EDIT[@sly7_7] I'd also give an other example, using ember-data: https://github.com/dgeb/ember_data_example

    ImageIO.write(dstImg, format, new File(destFile));

If I use `format = ""png""`, here is the result:

![png thumbnail][3]

If I use `format = ""jpg""`, here is the result:

![jpg thumbnail][4]


With [imagemagick identify][5] I've found out that the JPEG is saved with a quality of 75 that is totally insufficient to create a good looking thumbnail. The PNG doesn't look good either to me.

Here is the output of identify of the original file and the two thumbnails:

    $ identify 42486_1.jpg 42486_s1.jpg 42486_s1.png 
    42486_1.jpg JPEG 580x435 580x435+0+0 8-bit DirectClass 50.6KB 0.000u 0:00.000
    42486_s1.jpg[1] JPEG 77x58 77x58+0+0 8-bit DirectClass 2.22KB 0.000u 0:00.000
    42486_s1.png[2] PNG 77x58 77x58+0+0 8-bit DirectClass 12.2KB 0.000u 0:00.000

##Questions

* How to improve the quality of the generated thumbnail?  
* How to save a JPEG with a higher quality? I'd like to try with higher quality and compare the results. I couldn't find anything in the JavaDoc for ImageIO.write. 
* Why I tell Scalr that my maximum dimensions are 77x57 and it output an image 77x58? I think that is to maintain the proportion, but those are my maximum width and maximum height. Width or height could be less but not more.

**UPDATE**: With a web search I found an article about how to [adjust JPEG image compression quality][6]. I wrote my own method to save a BufferedImage setting the quality:

    /**
     * Write a JPEG file setting the compression quality.
     * 
     * @param image
     *                a BufferedImage to be saved
     * @param destFile
     *                destination file (absolute or relative path)
     * @param quality
     *                a float between 0 and 1, where 1 means uncompressed.
     * @throws IOException
     *                 in case of problems writing the file
     */
    private void writeJpeg(BufferedImage image, String destFile, float quality) 
    throws IOException {
        ImageWriter writer = null;
        FileImageOutputStream output = null;
        try {
            writer = ImageIO.getImageWritersByFormatName(""jpeg"").next();
            ImageWriteParam param = writer.getDefaultWriteParam();
            param.setCompressionMode(ImageWriteParam.MODE_EXPLICIT);
            param.setCompressionQuality(quality);
            output = new FileImageOutputStream(new File(destFile));
            writer.setOutput(output);
            IIOImage iioImage = new IIOImage(image, null, null);
            writer.write(null, iioImage, param);

        } finally {
            try {
                writer.dispose();
            } catch (Exception e) { }

            try {
                output.close();
            } catch (Exception e) { }
        }
    }

Here are the results. PNG:

![png thumbnail][7]

JPEG quality 75:

![jpg thumbnail][8]

JPEG quality 90 (the gravatars on stackoverflow are saved as JPEG quality 90):

![jpg thumbnail quality 90][9]

and the filesize:

    thumb90.jpg JPEG 77x58 77x58+0+0 8-bit DirectClass 6.89KB 0.000u 0:00.000

**UPDATE 2**: test to compare Scalr with [java-image-scaling][10].

    private void scaleAndSaveImageWithScalr(String sourceFile, String destFile, int width, int height)
        throws IOException {
        BufferedImage sourceImage = ImageIO.read(new File(sourceFile));
        BufferedImage destImage = Scalr.resize(sourceImage, Scalr.Method.QUALITY, width, height);
        writeJpeg(destImage, destFile, JPEG_QUALITY);
    }

    private void scaleAndSaveImageWithJImage(String sourceFile, String destFile, int width, int height)
        throws IOException {
        BufferedImage sourceImage = ImageIO.read(new File(sourceFile));
        ResampleOp resampleOp = new ResampleOp(width, height);
        resampleOp.setFilter(ResampleFilters.getLanczos3Filter());
        resampleOp.setUnsharpenMask(AdvancedResizeOp.UnsharpenMask.Normal);
        BufferedImage destImage = resampleOp.filter(sourceImage, null);
        writeJpeg(destImage, destFile, JPEG_QUALITY);
    }

JPEG quality 90 generated with Scalr:

![jpg thumb from scalr][11]

JPEG quality 90 generated with java-image-scaling:

![jpg thumb from java-image-scaling][12]

I didn't receive any further feedback, so my personal conclusion is that java-image-scaling provides superior quality, and so it's the library that I choose.

1. This error should only ever happen during development.  With proper testing, you should never see this error in production.  I always consider it a development level error and therefore a `NSLog` and `abort()` are appropriate.

2. If your data is replaceable (i.e. you are using CD to cache data from the internet, etc.) then yes it makes sense to delete the database on this error and rebuild it from scratch.  If your data is not replaceable then this is a terrible solution, see point 1.

And you call static method inside `myClass`, so it cannot work.

By the way, I would not recommend going that way, after some time you will truly regret using statics, introducing dependencies like this. 
And you create new `EntityManager` instance on every call (so a new connection), that is inefficient and will break doctrine behaviour (you can read about unit of work).

And you can then do something similar to what tincopper2 said; set a boolean to true/false depending on if the window is opening or closing.

 1. Brand  


 - Serie  Serie Serie  

the brand is in :

         <b><div id=""catmerk"">Brandname</div></b>   

under that div is an other div with the series like:   

          <b><div id=""catserie"">seriename</div></b>  


so all thedivs with brands have the same name  
is it possible with jquery if i click brandname 1 that everything in div catserie under the brand div toggles.  
so everything is closed in the beginning if i click a brandname it show the series with that brand so not all series of all brands.  
i hope you can understand my weak english.

1029420,,"Meeting the same problem and the last comment was from a month ago, so here is what I found out about heavy dataset query.

I guess I'm gonna use the ""Query cursor"" technique after reading those lines in the google docs [article][1] (the one in python mentioned by the way) :

> This article was written for SDK version 1.1.7. As of release 1.3.1,
> query cursors ([Java][2] | [Python][3]) have superseded the techniques described
> below and are now the recommended method for paging through large
> datasets.

In the google docs about ""[Query Cursor][2]"". 
The first line of the doc gives precisely why the need for *cursor* :

> Query cursors allow an app to perform a query and retrieve a batch of
> results, then fetch additional results for the same query in a
> subsequent web **request without the overhead of a query offset**.

The documentation provides also a **java example** of a servlet using the cursor technique. There is a tip how to generate a safe cursor for the client. Finally, limitations of *cursor* are exposed.

Hope this gives you a lead to resolve your problem.

Small reminder about range and **offset**, quite impacting on performance if forgotten (and I did^^) :

> The starting offset has implications for performance: the Datastore
> must retrieve and then discard all results prior to the starting
> offset. For example, a query with a range of 5, 10 fetches ten results
> from the Datastore, then discards the first five and returns the
> remaining five to the application.


----------
Edit: As working with **JDO**, I kept looking for a way to allow my previous code to load more than 1000 result in a single query. So, if you're using JDO too, I found this old [issue][4]:

    Query query = pm.newQuery(...);
    query.getFetchPlan().setFetchSize(numberOfRecordByFetch); 

----------

Edit 2: When using **JPA**, you can use a (somewhat hidden) [Datanucleus option][5]:

    query.setHint(""datanucleus.query.fetchSize"", fetchSize);

Note that you can also specify a value of `FetchPlan.FETCH_SIZE_GREEDY` to retrieve [all results][6] in a single fetch.

If you been through other programming languages, you might have used the 'new' keyword.

Malloc does exactly the same thing in C. It takes a parameter, what size of memory needs to be allocated and it returns a pointer variable that points to the first memory block of the 

entire memory block, that you have created in the memory. Example -

    int *p = malloc(sizeof(int)*10);

Now, *p will point to first block of the consecutive 10 integer block reserved on the memory.

You can traverse through each block using the ++ and -- operator. 
where p++ will point to the next element in the memory and p-- to the previous one.

1114965,,"I have developed a multi-field form with a search facility. I have used popup window for displaying search results and user may select one of those results to edit and get filled in the parent window. Also I need to pass two variables between jQuery and PHP to the page for formatting. I have done it all. The only problem I am facing is when form is submitted after closing the popup window, it is not evoking its `$(document).ready()` and `$(window).load()` methods.

**The code I used on popup window:**

    $(""#modify"").on('click', function () {
        var $ele = $('input[name=""rad_selected""]:checked');

        if ($ele.length) {
			var $tds = $ele.closest('tr').find('td');
			var id = $tds.eq(2).text();
			var requestor = $tds.eq(3).text();
			// and so on..
			//alert(id);            
			//alert(requestor);
			opener.document.frm_beneficiary.task.value =  ""modify"";
			opener.document.frm_beneficiary.role.value = 10;
			opener.document.frm_beneficiary.benid2.value =  trim(id);
			opener.document.frm_beneficiary.searchName2.value =  trim(requestor);
			self.close();
		}
        else {
            alert(""Select a record you want to edit."");
        }
    });

This passes all the four values to hidden fields of the form successfully. Even the search is also working fine.

**The code on parent window:**

    function submitForm()
    {
		
		with(document.frm_beneficiary)
		{
			alert(""submitform"");
			action = ""frm_ben_entry.php"";
			submit();
		}
    }

This `submitForm()` function is called after the popup is closed.

NOTE : `submitForm()` is called many a times in the page itself and evokes both the `$(document).ready()` and `$(window).load()` methods when used without POPUP in between. I am not getting what I am missing.

I just want these two jquery methods to be evoked when the page is reloaded.",Thanks removed,,1,41667.28913,$(document.ready) not evoked when form submitted to same page,<php><jquery><submit>,342,41597.19686,134,10,0,,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","<p>HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT,

Please note:  I am not using AJAX or PHP on my site.  I want everything to be solely made up of jQuery/CSS3/HTML/Javascript.  This means that it is not a one-page site.  There are a bunch of different html documents paired together with hyperlinks like a traditional website, and I want to know if theres a way to use javascript to, perhaps, preload the other pages so they are ready for the animation when clicked.

I'm looking for the same exact functionality as the link I've provided.  This means animate when clicked, reverse animate when going back, and preloading the pages so they're ready.

I have idea of putting escape character in each quotes symbols `'` or `""` before
passing arguments, on the other end I will get rid of escape character. Does JSON encoding do it?

However, with HTML 5 this is made possible by using the FileReader API. Currently support for this feature is limited to very recent versions of Chrome, Firefox and Opera. A similar feature exists in older versions of Firefox and this can also be done in older versions of Internet Explorer by using ActiveX. I would imagine that Google Gears also would allow this although I haven't looked into it. 

The Javascript to do this would look like:

    $( ""#files"" ).change( function( event )
    {
        var files = event.target.files;
        var fileReader = new FileReader();

I'm going to extract the strategy outlined in this blog post [about secure long-term authentication](https://paragonie.com/blog/2015/04/secure-authentication-php-with-long-term-persistence) since that covers a lot of ground and we're only interested in the ""remember me"" part.

# Preamble - Database Structure

We want a separate table from our users' table that looks like this (MySQL):

    CREATE TABLE `auth_tokens` (
        `id` integer(11) not null UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT,
        `selector` char(12),
        `token` char(64),
        `userid` integer(11) not null UNSIGNED,
        `expires` datetime,
        PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
    );

The important things here are that `selector` and `token` are separate fields.

# After Logging In

    if ($login->success && $login->rememberMe) { // However you implement it
        $selector = base64_encode(openssl_random_pseudo_bytes(9));
        $authenticator = openssl_random_pseudo_bytes(33);
        
        setcookie(
            'remember',
             $selector.':'.base64_encode($authenticator),
             time() + 864000,
             '/',
             'yourdomain.com',
             true, // http-only
             true  // TLS-only
        );
        
        $database->exec(
            ""INSERT INTO auth_tokens (selector, token, userid, expires) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)"", 
            [
                $selector,
                hash('sha256', $authenticator),
                $login->userId,
                date('Y-m-d\TH:i:s', time() + 864000)
            ]
        );
    }

# Re-Authenticating On Page Load

    if (empty($_SESSION['userid']) && !empty($_COOKIE['remember'])) {
        list($selector, $authenticator) = explode(':', $_COOKIE['remember']);
        
        $row = $database->selectRow(
            ""SELECT * FROM auth_tokens WHERE selector = ?"",
            [
                $selector
            ]
        );
        
        if (hash_equals($row['token'], hash('sha256', $authenticator))) {
            $_SESSION['userid'] = $row['userid'];
            // Then regenerate login token as above
        }
    }

# Details

We use 9 bytes of random data (base64 encoded to 12 characters) for our selector. This provides 72 bits of keyspace and therefore 2<sup>36</sup> bits of collision resistance (birthday attacks), which is larger than our storage capacity (`integer(11) UNSIGNED`) by a factor of 16.

We use 33 bytes of randomness for our actual authenticator. This should be unpredictable in all practical scenarios.

We store an SHA256 hash of the authenticator in the database. This mitigates the risk of user impersonation following information leaks.

We re-calculate the SHA256 hash of the authenticator value stored in the user's cookie then compare it with the stored SHA256 hash using `hash_equals()` to prevent timing attacks.

We separated the selector from the authenticator because DB lookups are not constant-time. This eliminates the potential impact of timing leaks on searches without causing a drastic performance hit.",This answer needed some modest clean-up.,,2,41860.48605,,,19146,41362.57713,2322,1032,278,https://paragonie.com,"Orlando, FL","<blockquote>

    int[] x = {2,5,6,9,45,48,54,76,97,102,134,203,234,245,267,289,299};
    
    List<int> y = new List<int>();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < x.Length; i++)
    {
        if ( (x[i] >= 31) && (x[i] <= 255) )
        {
             y.Add(x[i]);
        }
    }

So I use an array for `x`. Then I make a List called `y`. I would use the loop to check if the values meet the condition. If they do I will add them in the `y` List.

    foreach (int k in y)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(k);
    }

Use this loop just to make sure it works (optional).

But because this is an ordered array we can make this a more efficient though, by stopping our search after we are past our upper bound. We know none of those numbers will be within our bound. We can do this by simply breaking from the for loop.

    int[] x = {2,5,6,9,45,48,54,76,97,102,134,203,234,245,267,289,299};
    
    List<int> y = new List<int>();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < x.Length; i++)
    {
        if ( (x[i] >= 31) && (x[i] <= 255) )
        {
             y.Add(x[i]);
        }
        else if (x[i] > 255)
        {
           // We are past the upper bound, we are okay to stop the for loop now.
           break;
        }
    }

But beyond this we can make this still more efficient by implementing a [binary search][1] for the lower bound. What this does is instead of starting at the beginning of the array going through all the values, we can start in the middle. We can know by looking at value 97 (in the middle of the array) that our lower bound must be in the first half of the array.  This already splits the amount of searching we are doing in half. We can keep doing this, cutting the array in half until we find the value we are looking for.

Putting it all together it would look something like this.

    int[] x = {2,5,6,9,45,48,54,76,97,102,134,203,234,245,267,289,299};
    
    List<int> y = new List<int>();
    
	int lowerBoundIndex = binarySearch(array, 0, x.length, 31);

    for (int i = lowerBoundIndex; i < x.Length; i++)
    {
        if ( (x[i] >= 31) && (x[i] <= 255) )
        {
             y.Add(x[i]);
        }
        else if (x[i] > 255)
        {
           // We are past the upper bound, we are okay to stop the for loop now.
           break;
        }
    }
    
    public int binarySearch(int[] array, int lowerbound, int upperbound, int key) {
		int position;

		// To start, find the subscript of the middle position.
		position = (lowerbound + upperbound) / 2;

		while (!IsTargetIndex(array, position, key) && (lowerbound <= upperbound)) {
			if (array[position] > key) // If the number is > key, ..
			{ // decrease position by one.
				upperbound = position - 1;
			} else {
				lowerbound = position + 1; // Else, increase position by one.
			}
			position = (lowerbound + upperbound) / 2;
		}
		
		
		if (lowerbound <= upperbound) {
			return position;
		} 
		
		return -1;
	}

	public boolean IsTargetIndex(int[] array, int position, int key)
	{
		int current = array[position];
		int previous;
		if (position == 0)
			previous = -1;
		else
			previous = array[position -1];
		
		if ((previous < key) && (current >= key))
		{
			return true;
		}
		
		return false;
	}

The binary search was taken from [here][2], but I had to modify it because we are not looking for an exact match, but the first item that is larger or equal to the lower bound. This is done in IsTargetIndex.

This may or may not be overkill.  If your array is small, then this may not be a big performance gain. But imagine if your array was millions of nodes, then this could be a huge time saver.

Next time please show effort before you post a question. Also, this can be done with a simple algorithm so it's all about the loops. Even a beginner programmer should know this as long as you know arrays and loops basics. Welcome to Stack Overflow.

2594941,,"This is going to be a difficult one to explain but basically, I have an angular application with a login form which runs a function on submit which sends an ajax request to the server to do the login.

Now, I'm not using ng-submit but hijacking the normal submit attribute like this:

    <form my-form submit=""controllername.doSubmit()"">

I then have an angular directive called ""my-form"" which uses {require: 'form'} in it's definition object and then does this in the postLink function:

    element.bind('submit', function(event)
    {
        // Removed for brevity

        scope.$apply(scope.submit);
    });

So, basically, this form submit stuff was written a long time ago and does a lot of other stuff like triggering form validation and stuff by default so I don't wnt to rewrite any of this or go back to using ng-submit. Aside form anything else I have a few big apps using this code which would need to change a lot.

Anyway, it all works fine on the surface but if I fill in the log in form and then do some other stuff (including filling in other forms set up the same way) and then leave my laptop for a few days and come back to the page, somehow all the form data has been added to the URL bar, after the ?? and before the # including the password in plain view!

Not sure why this doesn't happen straight away, only after un-sleeping the PC, and not always. The other weird thing is that the names of the parameters are not the original ones (email, password) but the names of the parameters of the first form currently on the page (actionStatus, required), so Chrome is obviously getting very confused.

My instinct tells me that when the form is submitted, the formData is being stored somewhere for later because I'm not cancelling the default action of the form correctly when I'm running my javascript function and because it's a single page application that formData never leaves the memory. It's then thinking it's gone to a new page and putting that data in the Url, but it's getting the names wrong because the forms on the page have changed.

Sorry, I can't provide more code, just a fairly wooly description but I don't know what else to say really, it's all very strange.

Remember that if you change anything in the chart, the `<svg>` structure will change too. But with some little practice it becomes quite easy to find the xPath and ""translate"" it to a little useful script as above. I have the feeling that you want to have multiple vertical lines with different colors. Then there will just be a collection of `<rect>`'s instead of 1, you can target individually.

**Update**. As I wrote above, in case of multiple annotation lines you just have a collection of `<rect>`'s :

        // the main scope of the question, but some decent options are to have
        // a field that is initialized once and then re-used as needed or to
        // use ThreadLocalRandom (if using at least Java 1.7).
        Random rand = new Random();

See [the relevant JavaDoc][1].  In practice, the [java.util.Random][2] class is often preferable to [java.lang.Math.random()][3].

In particular, there is no need to reinvent the random integer generation wheel when there is a straightforward API within the standard library to accomplish the task.

In Java 1.7 or later, the following [method][4] is even more straightforward as long as there is no need to explicitly set the initial seed:

    import java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom;

    // nextInt is normally exclusive of the top value,
    // so add 1 to make it inclusive
    ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt(min, max + 1);

Apparently all php files were installed by webmatrix (including php-cgi.exe) so I can't figure out why word press (and the PHP starter site) fails and keeps throwing this error.

I even tried a totally new install of WebMatrix on an unused laptop with no existing PHP or mySql files and got exactly the same result. Apparently, there is a flaw built in to the WebMatrix program regarding running PHP.

I have a hard time believing that MSFT would even release this with such a functionality problem. I am not knocking MSFT because I think WM is an awesome product. But, if there are known post installation steps which need to be taken, a heads up would have been nice. I hope WebMatrix 3 users are not encountering the same problem.

In the way your structure is defined, compiler is allow to assume that you will never use more than `sizeof int64_t` for the variable member `int64_t c`. So if you try to write more that `sizeof int64_t`(aka. `sizeof c`) on `c`, you will have an out of bound in your code. This is the case because `sizeof ""aaaaaaaa""` > `sizeof int64_t`.

The point is, whatever the size you will allocate with your `malloc()`, the compiler is allow to suppose that you will never use more than `sizeof int64_t` in your `strcpy()` or `memcpy()` call. Because you send the address of `c` (aka `int64_t c`), not the structure.

TL;DR: You are trying to copy 9 bytes to a type consisting of 8 bytes(we suppose that byte is an octet). (From [@Kcvin][1])

If you want something similar use flexible array members from C99:

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <string.h>
    
    typedef struct {
      size_t size;
      char str[];
    } string;
    
    int main(void) {
      char str[] = ""aaaaaaaa"";
      size_t len_str = strlen(str);
      string *p = malloc(sizeof *p + len_str + 1);
      if (!p) {
        return 1;
      }
      p->size = len_str;
      strcpy(p->str, str);
      puts(p->str);
      strncpy(p->str, str, len_str + 1);
      puts(p->str);
      memcpy(p->str, str, len_str + 1);
      puts(p->str);

2938298,,">The future warning happens when you do something like this:

>     numpy.asarray([1,2,3,4]) == None
Which currently returns `False`, but I understand will return an array containing `[False,False,False,True]` in a future version of Numpy.

As I mentioned in the comments, your example (as originally given) is incorrect. Future versions of numpy would return `[False ,False, False, False]`, i.e. `False` for each element in the array that is not equal to `None`. This is more consistent with how element-wise comparisons to other scalar values currently work, e.g.:

    In [1]: np.array([1, 2, 3, 4]) == 1
    Out[1]: array([ True, False, False, False], dtype=bool)

    In [2]: np.array(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']) == 'b'
    Out[2]: array([False,  True, False, False], dtype=bool)

> What confuses me is this behaviour of the `in` keyword with a 1D array compared to a list

When you test `x in y`, you are calling `y.__contains__(x)`. When `y` is a list, `__contains__` basically does something along the lines of this:

    for item in y:
        if (item is x) or (item == x):
            return True
    return False

As far as I can tell, `np.ndarray.__contains__(x)` performs the equivalent of this:

    if any(y == x):
        return True
    else:
        return False

That is to say it tests element-wise equality over the whole array first (`y == x` would be a boolean array the size of `y`). Since in your case you are testing whether `y == None`, this will raise the `FutureWarning` for the reasons given above.

In the comments you also wanted to know why

    np.nan in np.array([1, 2, 3, np.nan])

returns `False`, but

    np.nan in [1, 2, 3, np.nan]

returns `True`. The first part is easily explained by the fact that `np.nan != np.nan` ([see here for the rationale behind this](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1573715/1461210)). To understand why the second case returns `True`, remember that `list.__contains__()` first checks for identity (`is`) before checking equality (`==`). Since `np.nan is np.nan`, the second case will return `True`.",Make it clear that the question no longer reflects the quoted text.,,2,42878.51688,,,528,41301.66392,15,49,2,http://szmoore.net,"Perth, Western Australia, Australia",,szmoore,,42759.2684
